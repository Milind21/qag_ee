Relatives of the victims, who held a memorial service in Belfast this week, are calling for an investigation into allegations of crown force collusion in the UVF bomb attack.Thirty years ago this week, on 4 December 1971, a UVF gang placed a bomb in the hallway of McGurk's bar in North Queens Street. Amongst the dead, which included children and pensioners, were several members of the bar owner, Patrick McGurk's family, who were upstairs in the living area at the time of the explosion. The building collapsed, trapping many of the victims under the rubble.Alex McLaughlin, whose father was killed in the attack, said there was a massive Crown force presence in the area in the week prior to the bombing in contrast to the night of the atttack.\"Two days earlier, three men had escaped from Crumlin Road jail and the RUC had swamped the area looking for them,\" said Alex. \"It seems strange that loyalists would choose that time to drive from Tigers Bay into a Catholic area to plant a bomb.\"Despite an eyewitness account identifying the bombing crew and the fact that the bombing was claimed by loyalists in the immediate aftrermath of the attack, the British authorities blamed the IRA.Journalists were briefed by senior members of the British Army, who claimed forensic evidence confirmed republicans were responsible for the explosion.In her study, \"Ireland: the Propaganda War,\" Liz Curtis describes how the British Army and RUC, with the assistance of much of the press, successfully diverted attention from the evidence of loyalist involvement and used the atrocity to discredit their principle enemy, the IRA.\"The McGurk's bar bombing had caused more casualties than any single previous incident,\" said Curtis, \"loyalists were responsible but never stood publicly condemned for it beyond nationalist areas.\"In 1978, a self-confessed UVF member, Robert Campbell, was convicted of the bombing together with the 1976 sectarian killing of John Morrow, a workman mistaken for a Catholic.Pat Arthurs, who was 14 years of age when her mother was killed in the bombing, has described how the 'disinformation' peddled by the RUC and British army left her confused and made it more difficult for her family to come to terms with the loss. Pat's father, who was also in McGurk's, survived the attack.In her heart, Pat always knew the bombing had been carried out by loyalists but there was always a doubt. And then there was the stigma. \"I had to grow up with people saying that maybe my mother or father had something to do with the murder of 15 people,\" said Pat.Mary Irvine, whose mother was killed in the bombing, said that while everyone else seemed to have forgotten about what happened, the people of the New Lodge Road and local community have supported relatives and survivors for thirty years.Mary particularly remembered the late Paddy McManus, a local Sinn Fein Councillor \"who had kept the memory of what happened in McGurk's alive.\"Almost a thousand people packed St. Patrick's Chapel on Donegall Street for a memorial mass this week. Following the service fifteen wreaths, one for each victim, were carried by relatives leading a silent candlelit procession to a new memorial at Great George's Street.At the site where so many had died, Fr David White condemned 'careless reporting' which had added to the grief.\"The bombing of Paddy McGurk's was a callous and cowardly sectarian act,\" said Fr White, \"and the enormous pain inflicted by the death of so many was intensified when the army and police personnel, together with the media, rushed to blame republicans.\"", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_0_news_7-E1",

Venezuelan people resurfaced to proudly stand today.As Venezuelans commemorate the 82nd anniversary of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces, Aug. 4 also marks a critical day in the country\u2019s recent history. One year ago, in a speech during the 81st anniversary, President Nicolas Maduro was the target of a failed assassination attempt.\"They not only came for me, but they also came for everyone, for the people, and for our country, wanting to undermine the peace and sovereignty of the nation,\" the president said Sunday remembering the frustrated attempt in a speech from the Military Academy in Caracas.\"But God intervened and like the phoenix, we resurfaced from the ashes of a terrorist attack and today a year later I can say that we are standing,\" he added, affirming, once again, the masterminds were the Colombian and United States government.On Aug. 4, 2018, an explosive-loaded drone detonated before reaching a stage where President Maduro was delivering a speech during a military parade in the capital. At that time, the Venezuelan right-wing opposition and its allies, one of which was the U.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton, said the explosion was \"a montage.\"\u201cAfter the brief moment of confusion, we knew it was an attack. There were many speculations and lies afterward in the networks but we insisted that it had been an assassination attempt,\u201d Mariela Lopez, a freelance videographer for HispanTV and Xinhua, remembered; as her images, taken in the precise moment of the explosion and the security team's response, were shown around the world.Despite the evidence, global mainstream media ridiculed the drone attack using qualifiers such as \"presumed\", \"supposed\", \"confusing event\" and \"alleged drones\". On Aug. 5, 2018, for instance, CNN Spanish titled an article \"the world reacts to the alleged attack against Nicolas Maduro.\"New videos obtained by CNN provide insight into last year's drone attack against #Venezuela's sitting president Nicolas #Maduro.It may be the world's first known attempt to kill a head of state with a retail drone.@npwcnn reports:https://t.co/A0qJ1Vd3cf \u2014 Michael Rios (@MikeRiosNews) March 14, 2019However, as time went on truth surfaced and on March 2019, CNN revealed unpublished images of how such attack was prepared on a Colombian farm, information which was provided by one of whom were involved in the attempted attack.The report agreed with the government's assertions about the attack.CNN then published an interview with a Venezuelan dissident who organized the attack. He admitted that the objective was to assassinate Maduro, an outcome which involved expecting some \"collateral damages.\"\"[Killing other people] was the risk we had to take,\" the attack organizer said in response to questions and explained that the drones were purchased online and imported to a Colombian farm, where plotters were training day and night in the handling of the devices.The Venezuelan conspirator also assured that U.S. government officials had three meetings with the plotters after the assassination attempt occurred. In those meetings, according to CNN, these officials only \"took notes\" on the background of the plan and its failure.On June 11, Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, Tarek William Saab, informed that 38 suspects have been indicted in the case of the frustrated assassination attempt and as investigations continue, of the 38 linked so far, 31 are deprived of liberty and seven received substitutive

After all, were Saddam -- against all odds and past practice -- actually to cooperate with the U.N. inspectors and assist in the complete elimination of his chemical and biological arsenals, he could resume covertly stockpiling them again in as little as six-months time.That period could be still shorter if he were to be rewarded for his \"cooperation\" by the elimination of international economic and trade sanctions against Iraq.A news item published in the London Evening Standard last Monday provides, however, an important reminder of why the United States cannot safely accept any substitute for the toppling of Saddam's regime.Specifically, it summarizes evidence implicating Saddam Hussein in one or more deadly acts of terror against the United States, specifically the Oklahoma City bombing.The Standard article draws on investigative reporting and forensic analysis into the Oklahoma City bombing performed over the past seven years by an intrepid and tenacious former TV journalist, Jayna Davis. She offers compelling, if circumstantial, indications that Iraqi operatives helped to plot, prepare and execute murderous attacks in Oklahoma City (and perhaps against other targets in the United States).For example, Ms. Davis has identified a man whose photo matches that of a \"John Doe #2\" sought immediately after the Murrah Building attack. He appears to be a Palestinian by the name of Hussain Hashem Al Hussaini, who sported a tatoo suggesting he had served in Saddam's elite Republican Guard.According to Davis' evidence, witnesses put Al Hussaini in the company of confessed bomber Timothy McVeigh a few days before the attack and near the site immediately beforehand. Ms. Davis has also found witnesses who say McVeigh and his convicted co-conspirator, Terry Nichols, had consorted with former Iraqi soldiers. Some of these former soldiers worked for a Palestinian who owned a truck very like one sought after the attack. These soldiers reportedly were absent from work on the day of the bombing and were seen celebrating after it occurred. It strains credulity that all of these dots are not connected.What is more, Ms. Davis' evidence appears consistent with findings by another investigator, Dr. Laurie Mylroie, who has devoted years of effort to the pursuit of Iraqi connections to the earlier World Trade Center bombing. Like Ms. Davis, Dr. Mylroie concludes that Saddam's modus operandi is to employ cut-outs to cover his tracks.According to this thesis, the first attempt aimed at destroying the Twin Towers was not exclusively accomplished by followers of a blind Egyptian sheik with ties to Iran. This conclusion was actually a bonus for Hussein, because it vectored blame at Iran, his most formidable enemy and neighbor. Similarly, Oklahoma City was not, as prosecutors claimed, simply the homegrown handiwork of two violently disaffected U.S. citizens.And Sept. 11 was not the product solely of Usama bin Laden's al Qaeda network. In each of these cases, there is reason to believe that Saddam Hussein and his minions played some role in the murder of Americans.To be sure, it is not exactly news that Ms. Davis has concluded that Iraqi operatives were involved in Oklahoma City. What is news is that, according to the Evening Standard, the Bush Justice Department has apparently, finally begun to take a serious interest in Ms. Davis' evidence.Such evidence simply serves strongly to reinforce a reality of which President Bush has long and repeatedly warned: We will enjoy no relief from Saddam's predations unless and until he and his ilk are removed from power in Iraq.The memory of those Americans who have already been murdered by the Butcher of Baghdad and his co-conspirators will be besmirched -- and the fate of untold numbers of their countrymen recklessly jeopardized -- if a temporary adjustment to Saddam's behavior on inspections were to be confused with, and allowed to substitute for, the needed elimination of his regime.Frank J.

He claimed the Colombian president, Juan Manuel Santos, was \u201cbehind the attack\u201d, supported by a network of plotters and financiers based in Florida, adding that a group of hired assassins had already been captured.Maduro, whose country is in economic and political turmoil, with inflation predicted to reach 1m% this year, has long accused the international community of waging economic war on him. He regularly lambasts the US as \u201cimperialist\u201d and says it is out to destroy socialism while taking over Venezuela\u2019s oil \u2013 of which it has the largest reserves in the world.The opposition within Venezuela is also a regular target. Maduro claims it wants to undo the social reforms brought about by previous president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the charismatic revolutionary who died in 2013. Maduro has jailed and sidelined many opposition activists, regularly accusing them of plotting to overthrow him.It is this conspiracy that Maduro claims will be unearthed in an ongoing investigation.Rightwing rebelsNo one has claimed responsibility for the alleged assassination attempt outright, though one group \u2013 Soldiers Franelas \u2013 suggested involvement in a tweet. \u201cWe have shown [the government] is vulnerable,\u201d the group said. \u201c[The attack] wasn\u2019t achieved today but it is just a matter of time [until it is].\u201d Little is known about Soldiers Franelas beyond their Twitter presence, where the group regularly posts anti-Maduro tweets.La operaci\u00f3n era sobrevolar 2 drones cargados con C4 el objetivo el palco presidencial, francotiradores de la guardia de honor derribaron los drones antes de llegar al objetivo.Demostramos que son vulnerables, no se logr\u00f3 hoy pero es cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo. #MilitaresPatriotas pic.twitter.com/teIEwygN3S \u2014 Soldados de Franelas (@soldadoDfranela) August 4, 2018The episode on Saturday reminded many in Venezuela of a similar incident last year when \u00d3scar P\u00e9rez, a rogue police officer, launched grenades from a stolen helicopter at government buildings in Caracas. P\u00e9rez was killed in a shootout six months later. Some analysts suspect Soldiers Franelas of involvement in that incident.A hoaxSome observers are suspicious of Maduro\u2019s account of events, saying it seems a little too neat in a country where the government has long twisted the truth to its own ends.\u201cThe official \u2018investigation\u2019 of today\u2019s alleged assassination attempt against president Maduro takes the usual course: begin with the conclusions and work backwards,\u201d Phil Gunson, a consultant with non-profit Crisis Group, tweeted on Saturday evening. \u201cIn a country where 98% of crime goes unpunished, government sleuths resolve this kind of case in a matter of hours.\u201dHe will use it to concentrate power, whoever did this David SmildeFirefighters interviewed by the Associated Press claimed that the bangs heard were caused by a gas tank explosion in a nearby apartment. Some local journalists have backed up the claim, posting photos on Twitter of smoke billowing from the Residancias Don Eduardo apartment building on the street where the attack took place.David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America, voiced doubts that the incident was a staged attack. In an interview with AP, he claimed footage of the chaotic scenes at the parade \u2013 which for a short while were broadcast to the nation before being abruptly cut off \u2013 made Maduro look weak.

But his opponents feared it would allow him to bypass the opposition-controlled parliament and regarded the president's decision as an attempted coup.The controversial vote comes amid protests that erupted in early April and have since claimed the lives of over 110 people. They followed an unsuccessful attempt of the Venezuelan Supreme Court to absorb the legislative power of the opposition-controlled parliament, the National Assembly.On July 16, the country's opposition has held an unofficial referendum, in which 7.2 million people took part and almost 6.4 million of them voted against the Constituent Assembly.

He said forensic investigation was still underway. The target of what police have said was an attack plotted by Driver was unclear.Driver, who also used the alias Harun Abdurahman, was arrested last year for openly supporting Islamic State on social media, but was never charged with a crime. Islamic State militants control parts of Iraq and Syria and they have supporters and sympathizers around the world who have carried out attacks on civilians in several countries.In February, Driver was placed on a peace bond, a court order that restricted his movements. It required he stay away from social media and computers and not have contact with Islamic State or similar groups.The RCMP has said officers sought out Driver on Aug. 10 after a tip from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation that morning, which included a \u201cmartyrdom video.\u201dCabana said police identified Driver from the video in part through his choice of balaclava.The incident called into question Canada\u2019s capabilities to combat extremism and increased calls for Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to abandon his plan to scale back a 2015 law that gave increased powers to police and intelligence agents.", "events": [{"event_id": "scenario_en_kairos_43-E1", "trigger": "detonate", "manual": [{"question": "What was used in the detonation?

The 21-year Chechen immigrant stood in a federal courtroom in Boston and admitted that he and his late older brother, Tamerlan, planted two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line of the legendary race on April 15, 2013, killing three people and leaving 264 others injured, including 17 who suffered severed limbs. \"I am sorry for the lives that I've taken, for the suffering that I caused you, for the damage I've done, irreparable damage\" Tsarnaev said in his first public remarks since his arrest. But Judge George O'Toole offered no sympathy for Tsarnaev as he handed down the death sentence, saying no one will remember the kind of person he was before the bombing. \"What will be remembered is that you murdered and maimed innocent people, and that you did it willfully and intentionally,\" said O'Toole.Before making his statement, Tsarnaev sat impassively and listened to three hours of testimony from 24 victims and survivors who told how the bombing had adversely affected their lives. The mother of Krystal Campbell, one of the three people killed in the bombing, lashed out at Tsarnaev, saying \"the choices that you made are despicable and what you did to my daughter is disgusting.\"Many of the survivors questioned and even rejected Tsarnaev's expression of remorse, calling it insincere. But one survivor, Henry Borgard, told reporters after the hearing that he accepted Tsarnaev's apology. \"I was actually really happy that he made the statement,\" said Borgard, who was injured as he was walking home from work that day. \"As I said in my personal impact statement, I have forgiven him. I have come to a place of peace and I genuinely hope that he does as well. For me to hear him say that he's sorry, that is enough for me.\" And the father of 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was also killed in the attack along with Campbell and Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, said he and his family have moved on. \"He chose hate. He chose destruction. He chose death,\u201d said Bill Richard. \u201cThis is all on him. We choose love. We choose kindness. We choose peace.\u201dThe jury voted unanimously last month to condemn Dzhokhar Tsarnaev to death, just days after convicting him on all 30 charges brought against him -- 17 of which carried the possibility of the death penalty. In addition to the three bombing victims, Tsarnaev was also convicted in the death of Sean Collier, a police officer with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Police Department killed during a shootout with the Tsarnaev brothers three days after the attack.His attorneys argued during the penalty phase of the trial that Dzhokhar was under the strong influence of his radicalized older brother, who was killed in the same shootout that killed MIT police officer Collier.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev will likely be sent to a federal prison in Indiana to await execution -- a process that could take years as his lawyers appeal his case through the federal court system.

bombers the night of the attack with interfering with the investigation into the deadly bombing.Khairullozhon Matanov, a 23-year-old taxi driver who lives in Quincy, Massachusetts, faces one criminal count of destroying records and three counts of lying to officials in a terrorism investigation, according to court papers filed in U.S. District Court in Boston.Brothers Tamerlan Tsarnaev, left, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are accused of carrying out the Boston Marathon bombing. Tamerlan was closely monitored while in Dagestan last year.Prosecutors said Matanov had been friends with accused bombers Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, spoke with both in the days after the blast but lied to police about the extent of his relationship with the pair.Matanov, who had hiked a New Hampshire mountain with Tamerlan Tsarnaev to \u201ctrain like, and praise, the 'mujahideen,\u201d' according to court papers, deleted searches related to the attacks from his computer, tried to dispose of cell phones he had used to contact the brothers, and denied knowing much about the pair in interviews with police.Matanov was not accused of playing a role in the April 15, 2013, bombing, which killed three people and injured 264. The Tsarnaev brothers have also been accused of shooting dead a police officer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology three days after the attack as they tried to flee Boston.Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, died after a shootout with police following that incident, while Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was apprehended early the next evening. The surviving brother, now 20, is awaiting trial and faces the possibility of execution if convicted.Matanov told an unidentified witness cooperating with the government that \u201cthe bombings could have had a just reason, such as being done in the name of Islam, that he would support the bombings if the reason were just or the attack had been done by the Taliban, and that the victims had gone to paradise,\u201d according to the papers.Matanov was arrested early Friday by members of the Joint Terrorism Task Force at his home in Quincy. He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of destroying evidence and eight years for each false statement count.He is the fourth person to face criminal charges for interfering with the investigation into the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.The others are three college friends of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev: Kazakhstan exchange students Dias Kadyrbayev and Azamat Tazhayakov, as well as Robel Phillipos of Cambridge. Prosecutors contended that after the FBI released photos of the suspected bombers, the three men realized the suspects' identities and removed a laptop and backpack containing empty fireworks shells from Dzhokhar's dorm room at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.", "events": [{"event_id": "8_VOA_EN_NW_2014.05.30.1925959-E1", "trigger": "charged", "manual": [{"question": "When was the

The explosion created a five-story, 150-feet-wide crater, filled with 4,000 tons of rubble, in the sub-grade levels of the towers and undermined the floor of an adjoining hotel.Hundreds of WTC tenants and visitors were trapped in elevators and on the observation deck, and thousands of others in the towers began to evacuate before first responders reached them.

Both wore blue jeans and dark hoodies, and had covered their faces.The motive for the attack is unknown.Sergeant Matt Bertram told the Associated Press the two men just \"dropped off this device, and took off right away\".\"We have no indication to call it a hate crime or any kind of terrorism act,\" he added.Canadian broadcaster CBC reported a heavy police presence, complete with \"tactical teams\" - and said an officer on the scene could not say whether there was a further threat to public safety.One eyewitness speaking to CBC said he was at a different restaurant nearby when the explosion happened. He suggested that a birthday party, possibly involving children, was taking place inside Bombay Bhel at the time of the blast.Meanwhile, Indian foreign minister Sushma Swaraj said she was in touch

2008 Times Square Bombing InformationNEW YORK \u2014\u00a0U.S. federal authorities on Wednesday announced an increased reward of $115,000 for information leading to the conviction of individuals responsible for the 2008 bombing in New York's Times Square.The FBI, which had offered a $65,000 reward in 2013, said it was actively pursuing several \"persons of interest,\" and has identified the origin of the explosive device's components.\"However, we're going to need more input and information from the general public if we're going to solve this case,\" Peter Tzitzis, an FBI special agent, told reporters.The bomb exploded at about 3:45 a.m. local time on March 6, 2008, at the Armed Forces Recruiting Station, a small, stand-alone building in the heart of Times Square. No one was wounded by the blast which caused only minor damage.Authorities have said a suspect on a blue Ross bicycle dismounted, placed the bomb at the recruiting station, lit the fuse and fled. The bicycle was found in a dumpster several blocks away.The suspect appeared to be working alone but could have had a lookout or a surveillance team of as many as five others, authorities said.At a press conference on Wednesday, FBI and New York Police Department officials said they believed the person who planted the device was male and that the incident was not tied to any foreign organizations.The explosion might be connected to two other New York bombings, one at the British Consulate in 2005 and another at the Mexican Consulate in 2007, the FBI said.The consulate bombs were also placed by someone on a bicycle and detonated between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., authorities said.The explosive device used in Times Square was detonated with a time fuse and built using an ammunition can commonly found on battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, the FBI said.The announcement of the new reward came as Boston marked the second anniversary of the attack on its annual marathon that killed three people and injured 264.While no one was harmed in the Times Square incident, the FBI said the case remained a \"top priority.\"In May 2013, Gerald Koch, a self-described anarchist from Brooklyn, was jailed after refusing to testify as a witness before a federal grand jury thought to be investigating the explosion. A federal judge ordered Koch's release in January 2014.The FBI's Tzitzis said several other individuals have come forward with information and \"good progress\" was being made.", "events": [{"event_id": "49_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.15.2720171-E1", "trigger": "exploded", "manual": [{"question": "What happened at the Armed Forces Recruiting Station?", "answer": "The bomb exploded."}, {"question": "When did the explosion occur?", "answer": "arch 6, 2008, at about 3:45 a.m. local time."}, {"question": "Was anyone injured in the explosion?", "answer": " No one was wounded by the blast."}, {"question": "Where did the explosion occur?", "answer": "At the Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Times Square."}], "gpt": [{"question": "What happened at the Armed Forces Recruiting Station?", "answer": "The bomb exploded."}, {"question": "When did the explosion occur?", "answer": "March 6, 2008, at about 3:45 a.m. local time."}, {"question": "Was anyone injured in the explosion?", "answer": "No one was wounded by the blast."}, {"question": "Where did the explosion occur?", "answer": "At the Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Times Square."}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "49_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.15.2720171-T3", "role": "ExplosiveDevice", "text": "bomb"}, {"entity_id": "49_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.15.2720171-T4", "role": "Target", "text": "Armed Forces Recruiting Station"}, {"entity_id": "49_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.15.2720171-T7", "role": "Place", "text": "Times Square"}]}, {"event_id": "49_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.15.2720171-E2", "trigger": "injured", "manual": [{"question": "Who was injured in the Boston Attack?", "answer": "264 "}, {"question": "When did the injury occur?", "answer": "during the Boston Marathon attack"}, {"question": "What caused the injury?", "answer": "the attack"}, {"question": "Where did the injury occur?", "answer": "Boston"}, {"question": "Who was not injured but killed?

It is frustrating to hide the facts,\" a senior interior ministry official in Kabul said.The complex attack on a highly secured base underlined the heavy pressure facing Afghan security forces as increasingly confident Taliban fighters have stepped up operations, even as diplomatic efforts to agree a peaceful settlement to the conflict have begun.Local officials said scores of troops and security personnel were killed in the attack.

The two were arrested on April 20, 2013, on immigration violations.U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock has said he will declare a mistrial if he finds the statements were not voluntary.Three people were killed and 264 injured in the bombing at the historic Boston Marathon.Kadyrbayev and Tazhayakov, both charged with obstruction of justice, could face up to 25 years in prison if convicted. A third friend, Robel Phillipos of Cambridge, Massachusetts, faces up to 16 years if convicted of the less serious charge of lying to investigators.Prosecutors have not charged any of the men with a role in the bombing itself. They contend that Tsarnaev, 20, and his brother, Tamerlan, 26, placed two homemade pressure-cooker bombs at the race's crowded finish line and three days later fatally shot a university police officer while attempting to flee the city.Tamerlan died after a gunbattle with police later that night. Dzhokhar is awaiting trial on charges that carry the threat of execution if he is convicted.

ExtremismWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0The Oklahoma City bombing nearly 22 years ago was an act of domestic terror by U.S. military veteran Timothy McVeigh and his accomplice, Terry Nichols. The bombing destroyed one third of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, killing 168 people and injuring 680 others. In his documentary, Oklahoma City, filmmaker Barak Goodman revisits the bombing as the first major domestic terrorist attack in the United States on April 19, 1995.It was the number of civilians killed - especially the 15 children, four of them infants, crushed inside the building's day care center - that made this terrorist attack by a massive fertilizer bomb so heinous for many Americans. Many films have recounted the story, but Goodman\u2019s documentary treats the Oklahoma City bombing as a springboard to examine the roots of America's ultra-right militia and to analyze the makeup of homegrown American terrorism.History of suspicion\u201cIt goes all the way back to the founding of the Republic,\u201d the filmmaker told VOA. \"The Republic was founded on the suspicion of government.\" Goodman says many of these extreme separatists believe in white supremacy and in unregulated freedom to keep and bear arms so that they can protect themselves from outsiders and the government.In the documentary, former militia member Kerry Noble explains the ideology. \u201cThe government is an enemy of the people, and in this war it\u2019s an all or nothing. We\u2019re either gonna win as the white race or we\u2019re gonna lose.\u201d FILE - In this April 21, 1995 file photo, Timothy McVeigh is led out of the Noble County Courthouse by state and federal law enforcement officials in Perry, Oklahoma, after being identified as a suspect in the bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal building. McVeigh was eventually convicted of the bombing and executed.Oklahoma City points to two events in the late 20th century that bolstered separatist ideologies: The Ruby Ridge incident on August 21, 1992, and the Waco siege in Waco, Texas, between February 28 and April 19, 1993. In both cases, federal and local government agents clashed with American separatists. The deadly incidents were fueled by the authorities' demand to search the premises for illegal firearms.The Waco siege was particularly deadly. The compound belonged to a group known as the Branch Davidians, led by David Koresh. When federal authorities sent in armed agents and armored vehicles to end the standoff, a fire engulfed the compound, killing 82 people, including David Koresh. Sixty-two of the victims were women and children.Birth of an extremistTimothy McVeigh, a Gulf War veteran disillusioned by the government during his tour in Iraq, was among those who went to witness the siege. According to the documentary, McVeigh was radicalized by those events and by an extremist publication called The Turner Diaries.\u201cIt\u2019s a Talisman for the far right, even to this day, but especially back in the '90s and '80s it was the \u2018Bible\u2019 of this movement,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cIt\u2019s a novel about a small group of \u2018patriots,\u2019 \u2018white patriots\u2019 who retake the government from the Jews and blacks who have infiltrated it, essentially. It\u2019s a racist creed and as I said, it is very poorly done. Intriguingly though, it describes the bombing of the FBI, the culmination of the novel, and it really lays out a recipe on how to build a bomb like this.\"That bomb is very similar to the one McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.\"McVeigh was deeply, deeply influenced by this book,\" Goodman adds. \"He sold it in gun shows, he quoted it, when he was arrested he had several pages of it in a folder beside him in a car. And it wasn\u2019t just McVeigh, it was all through this movement. People were really exorcised, impassioned, inflamed by this novel.\"FILE - In this May 5, 1995, photo, search and rescue personnel attend a memorial service in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma, destroyed by a fertilizer bomb in what is considered the first major domestic terrorist attack in the U.S.The documentary shows McVeigh obsessed with his guns and with the idea that the government was going to take them away. The film also points out that his exposure to the war in Iraq accelerated his feeling of mistrust of the U.S. government. \u201cThe way he put it made it sound he was emphatic towards the dead Iraqi soldiers that he killed. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case,\u201d says Barak Goodman. Instead, says the filmmaker, it was McVeigh\u2019s mistrust of the U.S. government, how it had blundered into Iraq and his idea of the U.S. government as a bully, and McVeigh, says Goodman, hated bullies. The Ruby Ridge and Waco stand-offs reinforced that idea in his mind.Homegrown extremismAccording to the documentary, there are 500 militia organizations in the U.S. today. Goodman believes they are as radicalized as ever. \u201cSome of them have gotten rid of their camouflage outfits and put on suits and ties, but really the rhetoric has been virtually the same for 100 years or more. \u2018It\u2019s a whites-only country, it should be a whites-only country, the federal government is in the hands of Jews, blacks, it\u2019s a conspiracy.'\u201dGoodman says it is a misconception to believe that this is a movement of white poor disenfranchised people. Certainly, he says, many are, but there also many professionals feeling a loss of entitlement, a loss of privilege and power. The filmmaker stresses that these people operate outside political parties and share a deep mistrust of the Washington political establishment.But Goodman cautions these extremists are not de facto terrorists. He says it takes a confluence of opportunity and a warped personality, often a lone individual, to commit a terrorist act of a scale such as the Oklahoma City bombing.\u201cMcVeigh was a shock to most people in the FBI. It would be less of a shock today. But it\u2019s very hard to prevent these things. One of the takeaways from our film and audiences who have seen it have been amazed at how really easy it was to do this. It cost about $6000, it was one guy, reading some literature,\u201d says the filmmaker.FILE - A member of a white supremacy group gives a fascist salute during a gathering in West Allis, Wisconsin, Sept. 3, 2011. \"The number of hate groups in the United States rose for a second year in a row in 2016 as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump,\u201d according to the Southern Law Poverty Center, a U.S. rights group.Goodman says in a politically polarized America, the possibility for future domestic terrorist attacks is high. \u201cIf you talk to people from the Southern Law Poverty Center, which tracks these groups, they are pounding on the wall, they are ringing the bell, they are saying, \u2018This is an ongoing threat, it\u2019s threat level midnight, it's rising, it's whatever the highest color is on the chart,'\u201d he says.The SPLC reports, \u201cthe number of hate groups in the United States rose for a second year in a row in 2016 as the radical right was energized by the candidacy of Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cThe most dramatic growth,\u201d it states, \u201cwas the near-tripling of anti-Muslim hate groups \u2013 from 34 in 2015 to 101 last year.\u201d Also, a wave of bomb threats and vandalism has rattled Jewish institutions around the country, but especially in the South. \u201cRight now, minorities feel particularly threatened,\u201d says the Oklahoma City filmmaker.\u201cThere is a very big difference between even hard gun rights activists and terrorists. I want to make that clear,\u201d says Goodman. \u201cI would take issue with the idea that they have infiltrated the administration. But it is a little galling to see the really mono focus on terrorists from abroad, terrorists influenced by ideas from abroad, whatever those ideas might be, and not on any real discussion about home-grown terrorism which has always been with us and which is not going away and which is actually -- if you look at the numbers of the incidents -- rivaling or exceeding those by that other group,\u201d he adds.Goodman hopes his film, Oklahoma City, will call attention to this rising threat and contribute to the conversation on the inherent dangers of domestic terrorism.", "events": [{"event_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-E1", "trigger": "bombing", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "What was the terrorist act committed in Oklahoma City?", "answer": "bombing"}, {"question": "Who committed the Oklahoma City bombing?", "answer": "McVeigh"}, {"question": "What was the cost of the bombing?", "answer": "about $6000"}, {"question": "How many people were involved in the Oklahoma City bombing?", "answer": "one guy"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-T53", "role": "Attacker", "text": "Timothy McVeigh"}, {"entity_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-T50", "role": "Attacker", "text": "Terry Nichols"}, {"entity_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-T57", "role": "Place", "text": "Oklahoma City"}]}, {"event_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-E2", "trigger": "killing", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "82 people, including David Koresh"}, {"question": "How were they killed?", "answer": "a fire engulfed the compound"}, {"question": "Who were the Branch Davidians?", "answer": "a group led by David Koresh"}, {"question": "Why did federal authorities send armed agents and armored vehicles to the compound?", "answer": "to end the standoff"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-T118", "role": "Victim", "text": "people"}]}, {"event_id": "7_VOA_EN_NW_2017.03.07.3753687-E3", "trigger": "injuring", "manual": [{"question": "Who was injured?", "answer": "680 people"}, {"question": "What caused the injuries?", "answer": "Oklahoma City bombing"}, {"question": "When did the injuries occur?", "answer": "April 19, 1995"}, {"question": " Where did the injuries occur?", "answer": "Alfred P.

"27_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.06.2708308": {"text": "Accused Boston Bomber Followed Brother's Lead, Defense Argues BOSTON \u2014\u00a0Accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev followed his older brother's lead in carrying out the 2013 bombing that killed three people, rather than acting on his own motivation, one of his attorneys argued on Monday.Tsarnaev, 21, could be sentenced to death if a jury finds him guilty of carrying out the April 15, 2013, attack and fatally shooting a police officer three days later as he and his brother, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, tried to flee the city.Following the prosecution's closing argument, that the ethnic Chechen defendant was an extremist who had \"wanted to punish America\" with the bombing attack, Tsarnaev's lawyers argued that he had been in the thrall of his older brother.Defense attorney Judith Clarke, who opened the trial last month by admitting that her client had committed all the crimes of which he is accused, repeated that assertion on Monday.\"There is no excuse. No one is trying to make one. Planting bombs at the Boston Marathon one year and 51 weeks ago was a senseless act,\" Clarke said.But in a counterpoint to the blunt \"it was him\" admission of her opening statement, Clarke told the jury that Tamerlan, who died four days after the bombing following a gunfight with police, had planned the attack and built the bombs.\"Tamerlan did that,\" she said. \"We need to understand who was leading and who was following.\"By shifting some of the blame to the older brother, Tsarnaev's lawyers are trying to persuade the jury, if they find the defendant guilty, to sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of parole rather than death.The jury on Monday also viewed video of Tsarnaev standing with a backpack in the crowd at the marathon's finish line minutes before the blasts that killed restaurant manager Krystle Campbell, 29, Chinese exchange student Lingzi Lu, 23, and 8-year-old Martin Richard.Tsarnaev is also accused of the fatal shooting of Massachusetts of Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, 26.'Wanted to Punish America'Prosecutors argued that the younger Tsarnaev shared his brother's violent ideology.\"The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen, the holy warriors,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. \"He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.\"Chakravarty noted that evidence showed that Tsarnaev, who moved to the United States from Russia a decade before the attack, had copies of al-Qaida's \"Inspire\" magazine on his computers.\"These were political choices,\" he said of Tsarnaev's actions. \"He was making a statement, 'an eye for an eye.'\"Hours after the gunfight with police, which ended when Dzhokhar sped off in a car, running his brother over in the process, the defendant hid in a boat parked in a backyard. While there, he wrote a note suggesting the attack was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.Monday's closing statements could be a preview of the arguments each side plans to make during the next phase of the trial, when the same jury will hear a fresh round of witness testimony before determining whether to sentence Tsarnaev to life in prison without possibility of parole, or to death.Richard's parents, William and Denise; dancer Heather Abbott, who lost both legs in the blast, and former Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis were among the people who packed the courtroom for closing arguments.The defendant sat quietly in court on Monday, dressed in a white shirt, dark jacket and no tie. He did not speak.The surveillance video viewed by the jury on Monday shows a bomb, which the defendant is charged with leaving in front of the Forum restaurant near the finish line, going off with a blinding flash, killing Richard and Lu. The jury also saw video taken by a man injured in the blast.The graphic video captures the chaos of the immediate aftermath, with one responder yelling that he was worried about the possibility of an additional blast and another voice screaming, \"We're on fire here. We're on fire.\"", "events": [{"event_id": "27_VOA_EN_NW_2015.04.06.2708308-E1", "trigger": "bombing", "manual": [{"question": "Who carried out the bombing?", "answer": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev"}, {"question": "What was the result of the bombing?", "answer": "Three people were killed"}, {"question": "When did the bombing occur?", "answer": "April 15, 2013"}, {"question": "How many did the bombing kill?

MUST WATCH Mailbox might have saved this man's life 03:13-- One was housed in a pressure cooker hidden inside a backpack, the FBI said.The device also had fragments that may have included nails, BBs and ball bearings, the agency said.-- The second bomb was in a metal container, but it was unclear whether it was in a pressure cooker as well, the FBI said.-- Photos obtained by CNN show the remains of a pressure cooker found at the scene, along with a shredded black backpack and what appear to be metal pellets or ball bearings.-- They were sent to the FBI's national laboratory in Virginia, where technicians will try to reconstruct the devices.-- In the past, the U.S. government has warned federal agencies that terrorists could turn pressure cookers into bombs by packing them with explosives and shrapnel, and detonating them with blasting caps.-- Authorities sifted through thousands of pieces of evidence and a mass of digital photos and video clips.They have pleaded for the public's help in providing additional leads and images.The casualtiesThe blasts left three people dead.-- Martin Richard , an 8-year-old boy with a gap-tooth grin and bright eyes.He loved to run and play in his yard.-- Krystle Campbell , a 29-year-old freckle-faced woman described as having \"a heart of gold.\"-- The third victim was Lingzu Lu , a graduate student at Boston University, who had moved to the city last fall, making friends and soaking up new experiences.-- Of the approximately 178 people injured, 66 remain in area hospitals, according to the latest CNN tally.Thirteen of those are still in critical condition, hospital officials said.- Martin's mother and sister are among the wounded.His mother underwent surgery for a brain injury, and his 6-year-old sister lost her leg.The injuries-- Doctors say dozens of victims suffered injuries to their legs that involve blood vessels, bone and tissue.-- The bombings resulted in at least 13 amputations and left doctors picking ball bearings out of victims in the emergency room, a terrorism expert briefed on the investigation said.-- Dr. George Velmahos, head of trauma care at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his team found \"numerous\" metal pellets and nails inside patients' bodies.\"There are people who have 10, 20, 30, 40 of them in their body, or more,\" Velmahos said.-- Dr. Ron Walls also said one patient had more than 12 carpenter-type nails.\"There is no question some of these objects were implanted in the device for the purpose of being exploded forward,\" he said.Terror group links-- While the clues moved the investigation forward, it is still unclear whether the attack was an act of domestic or foreign terrorism.-- No connection has been made to any terrorist group or individual.-- President Barack Obama described the bombings as an act of terrorism, but said it is unclear whether they were the work of a group or \"a malevolent individual.\"-- The Pakistani Taliban has said it was not involved in the attack.-- Authorities don't have a sense of what the motive is, an official said.-- The FBI asked the public to report anyone who talked about targeting the marathon or showed interest in explosives.The agency urged anyone who might have heard explosions in remote areas -- possibly by someone testing a bomb -- or seen someone carrying \"an unusually heavy, dark-colored bag\" around the time of the attack to come forward.'Possible' suspectsThree days later, authorities have yet to make an arrest, but have made \"significant progress,\" a law enforcement official said.-- Investigators have pinpointed two men of \"high interest\" as possible suspects after they appeared in images near the finish line moments before the blasts, a law enforcement official said.-- One of the men is seen carrying a black backpack.-- Authorities had not yet named the two, but their photographs have been distributed to law enforcement, a source said.-- Earlier Wednesday, two sources with knowledge of the investigation identified a man as a possible suspect in the attack, but did not name him.-- Seen on a video, the man wore a white baseball cap.One of the sources added that the cap was on backwards and the man was also wearing a light-colored hooded sweatshirt and a black jacket.-- It was not immediately clear if he is one of those alluded to in the photographs distributed to law enforcement officials.-- Investigators are closer to cracking the case \"every hour,\" Massachusetts Gov.Deval Patrick said.He urged patience with the probe to allow investigators space to do their job.-- \"I wish they had nailed the perpetrator within minutes of this catastrophe, but I understand from experience it's going to take some time,\" he said.The Investigation-- Significant progress has been made in the investigation, but there has been no arrest, the FBI told CNN.-- After sources told CNN on Wednesday that an arrest had been made, sources with the Department of Justice and Boston Police Department each said that no arrest had been made.-- A source with Boston law enforcement said, \"We got him,\" but would not clarify whether that meant an identification had been made or an arrest carried out.-- Some federal sources said that it would be going too far to say even that an identification had been made, but several sources in Boston disputed that, saying a clear identification had been made.-- Investigators believe they have identified a suspect in the marathon bombings, a source who has been briefed on the investigation told CNN's John King.The possible breakthrough came from an analysis of video from a Lord and Taylor department store near the site of the second blast, and video from a Boston TV station helped as well, the official said.-- As they scramble to search for suspects, authorities are processing \"the most complex crime scene that we have dealt with in the history of our department,\" said Ed Davis, the Boston police commissioner.-- Forensic specialists and dogs trained to detect explosive devices and their residue were at the scene of the blasts.A command post has been created, with 1,000 officers conducting interviews and gathering details.-- Authorities have received 2,000 tips from around the world, said Richard DesLauriers, the special agent in charge of the FBI's Boston office.\"Someone knows who did this,\" he said.Security elsewhere-- Cities have stepped up security after the attacks, including Washington, New York, Miami, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.-- British police said they are reviewing the security plan for the London Marathon scheduled for Sunday.The marathon will observe 30 seconds of silence and is urging runners to wear a black ribbon to mark the Boston tragedy.Reaction-- \"Boston is not going to be intimidated by this,\" said Secretary of State John Kerry, a former U.S. senator from Massachusetts.\"But we are going to find out who did this.The police work being done is extraordinary.The FBI is remarkable.There is a great deal of forensic evidence.We are hopeful we can bring people to justice.\"\"The Islamic Republic condemns killing of innocent people in U.S. Boston, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria in equal measure,\" Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Wednesday, according to a report on state-run Press TV.Tributes-- Obama and first lady Michelle Obama will travel to Boston on Thursday for an 11 a.m. interfaith service dedicated to the victims.The president is expected to meet with the families of those wounded or killed.--Obama declared an

The FBI said in a statement that day that an FBI special agent, along with two Massachusetts State Police troopers and other law enforcement personnel, were interviewing Todashev in connection with the Boston Marathon bombing investigation, and that he was shot after he initiated a \"violent confrontation.\"According to the bureau, the special agent \"sustained non-life threatening injuries\" during the incident.After the incident, some U.S. media quoted unnamed U.S. officials as saying that Todashev, a 27-year-old mixed martial arts fighter, had lunged at the agent with a knife. On Wednesday, the Washington Post newspaper quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying that Todashev had lunged at the agent but was unarmed.The FBI said Wednesday that is conducting a review of the incident to determine \"the reasonableness of the application of deadly force.\"The Council on American-Islamic relations, an advocacy group, said Wednesday it is asking the U.S. Department of Justice's civil rights division to investigate the incident.U.S. media also reported that while being questioned by the FBI, Todashev had implicated himself and Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev in a September 2011 triple slaying in a Boston suburb.Todashev formerly lived in the Boston area and trained in martial arts at a gym with Tsarnaev, a Boston resident.

took place near an area where many minority Shiite Muslims live.At least ten Hazara, including nine Shiites, were among the dead.Two paramilitary soldiers were also killed in the bombing.PM Imran Khan expressed condolences for the lives lost, directed the authorities to ensure the best medical treatment for the injured, and ordered an increase in security for Shiites and Hazara people.Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and ISIL later accepted responsibility for the attack, stating that \"their target were Hazara people.\"== Background ==Hazaras have been frequently targeted by Taliban and

potato stall in a crowded Hazarganji vegetable market.One survivor reported the blast being so powerful that the air was filled with black smoke and people were unable to hear each other.20 people including one paramilitary soldier were killed, as well as the perpetrator.On 16 April, one more paramilitary soldier died of his injuries.== Responsibility ==Initially, no group claimed

spokesperson of the group, Qari Saifullah, told CNN \"We claim responsibility for the attack in Quetta, we targeted the Hazara community.\"The same group had previously carried out attacks against Hazara minorities.ISIL also claimed the responsibility of this attack, releasing a photograph of the bomber along with his name.Various Sunni militant groups in Pakistan, including  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, have been backed by ISIL for several years.== Reaction ==Pakistan's ruling Government PTI condemned the attack and wrote on Twitter: \"We strongly condemn the terrorist attack in #Quetta that resulted

community failed once again on security purposes.Hazaras demanded security from Prime Minister Imran Khan.Shortly after the bombing struck near a Shiite residential area, dozens of angry Shiite youths

stands united.\"Earlier, talking to media persons in Quetta, the president had reaffirmed the government's commitment towards the implementation of the National Action Plan and  commended CM Balochistan's commitment of announcing a compensation package for the victims.Meanwhile, Opposition Leader Bilawal Zardari condemns the government and point out their duel standards, he said, \"On one

be able to touch them, Till when will have these dual standards, till when will this terrorism continue, victims need to be mainstreamed not terrorists.\"He showed condolence to the victims and also praised the army for eliminating the terrorists in recent years but he also provoked the emotional sentiments, stated, \u201cNo one can fight extremism alone, but we have to decide for the future.We need to fight this extremist mindset.When we ask for justice, we are called an enemy of the state.When I speak against banned organisations, I\u2019m branded an enemy of the state.\"he referred to his

We didn't make it, but it's a matter of time before we do,\" said Salvatore Lucchese, a former Caracas police chief now in exile.Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018. Venezuelan opposition activist Salvatore Lucchese speaks during an interview with Reuters in Bogota, Colombia Aug. 6, 2018.Lucchese claimed to have been part of the plot in an interview with Reuters this week in which he called for an armed overthrow of Maduro's leftist regime.Maduro was addressing a ceremony of the paramilitary National Guard in central Caracas when he came under attack from two drones packed with explosives. The government claims that one of the drones was diverted electronically while the second crashed into a nearby apartment building.Carratu confirmed that Venezuela, a longtime ally of Cuba, has the technology to electronically penetrate and interfere with the electronic signals of aircraft. But he ridiculed claims made on Twitter by persons saying they were involved in the attack that the drones had been shot down with firearms.\"Plastic explosives can't be detonated with bullets. They more likely exploded prematurely due to poor preparations by the hit team,\" he said.Lucchese's claim of responsibility for the attack came Wednesday but could not be independently confirmed. Responsibility has been claimed by a confusing array of spokesmen purporting to represent former and active members of Venezuela's security services, going by various names including \"The Resistance,\" \"Fenix Group\" and \"Soldiers in T Shirts.\"Lucchese was jailed by the Venezuelan government in 2014 for refusing orders to suppress opposition protests in his city. He took up political activity upon his release in 2016, when he objected to political negotiations with Maduro, but fled the country shortly afterward to avoid being arrested again.He did not reveal his location in the Reuters interview, but members of the Venezuelan government assert that he is in neighboring Colombia, a country that Maduro accuses of backing attempts to topple him.Exiled Venezuelan opposition journalist Patricia Poleo, long known for her close connections with the military, broadcast a statement from Miami that she claimed had been issued by officers in Venezuela. It said the officers were resorting to \"armed struggle\" because \"the regime has consistently ignored the constitution.\"Some opposition leaders have cast doubts on the claims of responsibility, suggesting instead that the attack was staged by the government to justify further repression.Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliame Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018. Julio Borges, president of the Venezuelan parliament, arrives for a meeting with Ernesto Macias, president of Colombia's Senate, at the Congress in Bogota, Colombia, Aug. 8, 2018.The Maduro government this week has rounded up a half dozen military officers it accused of conducting the attacks and has issued arrest warrants for at least two opposition leaders, including congressional Speaker Julio Borges, who is in Colombia.Lucchese's police background crisscrossed with that of police lnspector Oscar Perez,who last year attacked Venezuela's Supreme Court from a helicopter with hand grenades and machine-gun fire. The attack came as the court's seven judges assumed the powers of parliament to allow Maduro to rule autocratically.Perez also machine-gunned a building housing Maduro's new handpicked national assembly, which had just ousted Attorney General Luisa Ortega for accusing Maduro of corruption and authoritarian rule.The Caracas metropolitan police, which has been largely dissolved by the Maduro government, maintained close links with opposition leaders. Lucchese was a member of the same Christian democratic First Justice party as Caracas Mayor Leopoldo Lopez, one of the most charismatic anti- government leaders who has been repeatedly imprisoned by Maduro.Perez was a subordinate to Lucchese in the police criminal investigations unit and the special operations brigade.

The jury unanimously determined that, based on the \"aggravating and mitigating circumstances,\" Tsarnaev should be sentenced to death.Karen Snyder, right, and Kathryn Vanwie react to the announcement of the death penalty verdict for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev outside the John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse in Boston, May 15, 2015.Unanimous decisionThe jury had to reach a unanimous decision for Tsarnaev to receive the death penatly. Otherwise, he would have spent the rest of his life in prison without parole.VOA's Fatima Tlisova reported from the courtroom that some of the jurors were crying as Tsarnaev sat with his head down.In a statement following the verdict, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch accused Tsarnaev of \"coldly and callously\" perpetrating a terrorist attack. She said no verdict can \"heal the souls of those who lost loved ones, nor the minds and bodies of those who suffered life-changing injuries.\"But she said the death penalty is a \"fitting punishment for this horrific crime\" and said she hoped the case's completion brings closure to the victims and their families.U.S. Attorney Carmen Ortiz, who prosecuted the case, said at a news conference that the verdict was \"fair and just.\" She said Tsarnaev believed in an ideology of hate and expressed that ideology by killing and maiming Americans, noting that he will \"pay with his life.\"Vincent Lisi, the FBI special agent in charge of the case, said the bombing victims motivated and inspired the investigators every day.Tsarnaev, 21, was found guilty last month of all 30 terrorism and other charges. Of those, 17 carried the possibility of the death penalty.Jurors' deliberationsJurors were required to fill out a lengthy, complicated verdict form that asked them to make findings on 12 aggravating factors prosecutors said support a death sentence and 21 mitigating factors Tsarnaev's lawyers said instead support a sentence of life in prison.The jurors then had to weigh any mitigating factors against any aggravating ones to determine Tsarnaev's sentence.During the penalty phase of the judicial proceedings, prosecutors brushed off defense arguments that Tsarnaev was under the strong influence of his older, radicalized brother, Tamerlan, who was killed in a police shootout.They said even though he was only 19 at the time of the marathon bombing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was old enough to know right from wrong, and he wanted to avenge U.S. wars in Iran and Afghanistan.The Boston Marathon bombing was one of the bloodiest terrorist attacks in the United States since September 11, 2001.Two pressure-cooker bombs packed with shrapnel exploded near the marathon finish line on April 15, 2013. The Tsarnaev brothers also killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days later.Mike Eckel and Mike Richman contributed to this report from Washington.

assembly that opposition leaders fear will trigger the end of democracy in Venezuela.The office tweeted that 28-year-old Angelo Mendez and 39-year-old Eduardo Olave were killed at a protest Sunday in Merida. Thirty-year-old Ricardo Campos was killed in a separate incident in Sucre.Few details were provided on the deaths.Leaders with the opposition Democratic Action party on Twitter identified Campos as the group's youth secretary in Sucre, a state in northern Venezuela east of the nation's capital.Get Breaking News Delivered to Your InboxThe deaths bring the total to at least 122 killed in nearly four months of political upheaval.Demonstrators watch a barricade burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election is being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersMeanwhile, Venezuelans appeared to be abstaining in massive numbers on Sunday in a show of silent protest against a vote to select a constitutional assembly giving the government virtually unlimited powers.Associated Press journalists toured more than two dozen polling places in neighborhoods across the capital, including many traditional strongholds of the ruling socialist party in southern and western Caracas. Virtually all the polling places saw hours-long lines of thousands of people in past elections over the last two decades of socialist government.One site, a sports and cultural complex known as the Poliedro, had several thousand people waiting about two hours to vote, many having traveled from opposition-dominated neighborhoods where polling places were closed. Of the dozens of others sites seen by the AP, two in the loyalist-heavy neighborhood of El Valle had lines of approximately 200 to 400 people. All the others had at most a couple of dozen voters, and many had less than a half-dozen or were completely empty.Opinion polls say more than 70 percent of the country is opposed to Sunday's vote.\"People aren't in agreement with this,\" said Daniel Ponza, a 33-year-old drywall contractor, as he watched a few dozen people outside a polling place in El Valle. \"People are dying of hunger, looking for food in the trash. And I think this is just going to make things worse.\"Sunday evening, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations sent a message on Twitter calling the Venezuela election a \"sham\" and \"step toward dictatorship\":Maduro\u2019s sham election is another step toward dictatorship. We won't accept an illegit govt. The Venezuelan ppl & democracy will prevail. \u2014 Nikki Haley (@nikkihaley) July 30, 2017In opposition-dominated eastern Caracas, riot police used tear gas to stop protesters from gathering for a march on the capital's main highway. At least three police were wounded when one of their motorcycles detonated in a powerful explosion. The cause of the explosion was not immediately clear.After voting at dawn, President Nicolas Maduro called for international acceptance of what he called his government's fight against a violent opposition trying to sabotage his administration.Motorcycles burn after clashes broke out while the Constituent Assembly election was being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, on Sun., July 30, 2017. ReutersThe run-up to the vote has been marked by months of clashes between protesters and the government that have left at least 116 dead and nearly 2,000 wounded. A 61-year-old nurse was fatally shot by men accused of being pro-government paramilitaries during a protest at a church a few hundred feet from the school where Maduro voted.\"We've stoically withstood the terrorist, criminal violence,\" Maduro said. \"Hopefully the world will respectfully extend its arms toward our country.\"In an unusual moment this morning when Maduro cast his own ballot on state-controlled national television, his national ID card was to be scanned. He intended to make a statement that his vote was counted and said: \"We are going to verify my national ID card so that the record shows that I came to vote and my ID card will show this for posterity, that I voted on this historic day of the constituent assembly of July 30th.\"Nicolas Maduro having his national ID card scanned. ReutersWhen the female official of the National Electoral Council (CNE) proceeds to use a smartphone to scan Maduro's card, a second camera zooms in to reveal that according to CNE's own system, that \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\"After scanning Maduro's national ID card, the smartphone read: \"person does not exist, or the card has been revoked.\" ReutersMaduro appears livid but doesn't acknowledge the misshap, pauses for a second and then grabs his wife's ID card for scanning.Social media was abuzz with the misshap, which fanned the flames of speculation about the place of birth of the socialist president, whose mother is rumored to be a Colombian national. Following an opposition-mandated special commission investigation into the matter, the socialist-majority Supreme Court issued a ruling last October that stated that Maduro had been born in Caracas in 1962, but did not produce a birth certificate.Some opposition leaders continue to sustain that they have proof that Maduro was born a Colombian national, which would make him constitutionally ineligible to occupy the presidency.Maduro's highly vocal critic and former president of Colombia ridiculed Maduro in a tweet that reads: \"My fellow countryman, didn't they let you vote?\"Paisano \u00bf No te dejaron votar? https://t.co/ouVWI4eMtS \u2014 Andr\u00e9s Pastrana A (@AndresPastrana_) July 30, 2017Despite that hiccup, the opposition is boycotting Sunday's vote, contending the election has been structured to ensure Maduro's socialist party continues to dominate. So all 5,500 candidates for the 545 seats in the constituent assembly are his supporters and the vote's success is being measured by turnout.The government is encouraging participation with tactics that include offering social benefits like subsidized food to the poor and threatening state workers' jobs if they don't vote.\"I'm here because I'm hoping for housing,\" said Luisa Marquez, a 46-year-old hairdresser.Others said they were there out of conviction that the constitutional assembly would help the government fend off what they called an international capitalist conspiracy to undermine Venezuela's socialist system with the help of the domestic opposition.\"The crisis, the shortages of food and medicine, that isn't the government's fault,\" said Luis Osuna, a 42-year-old private bodyguard. \"Those who are attacking us to kill us with hunger and blame the government are the same enemies the government's always had.\"Women shout slogans during a protest held by Venezuelans in Spain against Venezuela's Constituent Assembly election, in Madrid, Spain, on July 30, 2017. ReutersOnce one of Latin America's wealthiest nations, Venezuela has spiraled into a devastating crisis during Maduro's four years in power, thanks to plunging oil prices and widespread corruption and mismanagement. Inflation and homicide rates are among the world's highest and widespread shortages of food and medicine have citizens dying of preventable illnesses and rooting through trash to feed themselves.The special assembly being selected Sunday will have powers to rewrite the country's 1999 constitution but will also have powers above and beyond other state institutions, including the opposition-controlled congress.While opinion polls say a vast majority oppose him, Maduro made clear in a televised address Saturday evening that he intends to use the assembly to govern without limitation, describing the vote as \"the election of a power that's above and beyond every other.\"He said he wants the assembly to strip opposition legislators of their constitutional immunity from prosecution and indicated he eager to prosecute many more members of the opposition parties that control a handful of state governments along with the National Assembly, providing one of the few remaining checks on the power of the socialist party that has ruled this OPEC nation for nearly two decades.\"The right wing already has its prison cell waiting,\" the president said. \"All the criminals will go to prison for the crimes they've committed.\"Saying the assembly will begin to govern within a week, Maduro said its first task in rewriting the constitution will be \"a total transformation\" of the office of Venezuela's chief prosecutor, a former government loyalist who has become the highest-ranking official to publicly split from the president.The Trump administration has imposed successive rounds of sanctions on high-ranking members of Maduro's administration, with the support of countries including Mexico, Colombia and Panama. Vice President Mike Pence promised on Friday that the U.S. would take \"strong and swift economic actions\" if the vote went ahead. He didn't say whether the U.S. would sanction Venezuelan oil imports, a measure with the potential to undermine Maduro but cause an even deeper humanitarian crisis here.Maduro's supporters on the Supreme Court set off the protests and clashes between police and demonstrator when they tried to strip the National Assembly of its powers in April. Most of the dead have been protesters apparently shot by police and government-linked paramilitaries.The opposition has organized a series of work stoppages as well as a July 16 protest vote that it said drew more than 7.5 million symbolic votes against the constitutional assembly.", "events": [{"event_id": "scenario_en_37-E1", "trigger": "burn", "manual": [{"question": "What burned?", "answer": "Motorcycles"}], "gpt": [{"question": "What burned?", "answer": "Motorcycles"}, {"question": "When did the burning occur?", "answer": "July 30, 2017"}, {"question": "Where did the burning occur?", "answer": "Caracas, Venezuela"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "scenario_en_37-T221", "role": "Artifact", "text": "barricade"}]}, {"event_id": "scenario_en_37-E2", "trigger": "detonated", "manual": [{"question": "What was detonated?", "answer": "a motorcycles"}], "gpt": [{"question": "Who detonated the motorcycle?", "answer": "The motorcycle detonated on its own.

this was the most devastating day of violence in Belfast up to that time, and many of the injured suffered serious mutilation, the impact on public opinion was enormous, and many observers regarded it as a point at which PIRA [Provisional Irish Republican Army] put itself outside the pale of political negotiation. Flackes and Elliott (1994) Northern Ireland: A Political Directory 1968-1993 Many watching the television news reports were reduced to tears by horrifying pictures of firemen and rescue workers ... scraping up the remains of human beings into plastic bags ... Bardon (1992) A History of Ulster 'Bloody Friday' is the name given to the events that occurred in Belfast on Friday 21 July 1972. During the afternoon of 'Bloody Friday' the Irish Republican Army (IRA) planted and exploded 22 bombs which, in the space of 75 minutes, killed 9 people and seriously injured approximately 130 others. In addition to the bombs there were numerous hoax warnings about other explosive devices which added to the chaos in the streets that afternoon. Many people believe these hoax warnings were deliberately used to reduce the effectiveness of the security forces in dealing with the real bombs. As the quotes above make clear, the killing and maiming had a profound impact on most people in Northern Ireland. 'Bloody Friday' also led to the decision by the British Government to implement 'Operation Motorman' when, in the biggest British military operation since the 1956 Suez crisis, the British Army entered and ended the 'no-go' areas of Belfast and Derry.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_8-E1", "trigger": "exploded", "manual": [{"question": "Who exploded the bomb?

alleged drone attack in CaracasSecurity forces take security measures around the site after an explosion was heard while Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was attending a ceremony to celebrate the 81st anniversary of the National Guard in Caracas on August 4, 2018.Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro survived an alleged assassination attempt via drone on Saturday when a flying device carrying explosives detonated during a speech he was delivering in Caracas.Maduro, an unpopular leader who has presided over one of the worst economic collapses in Latin America in recent history, blamed the \"far right,\" including Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos, for the attack.Here\u2019s what happened: On Saturday evening, Maduro was addressing the crowd at a military parade celebrating the 81st anniversary of the National Guard when a flying device approached and exploded, according to Venezuelan officials.Footage of the event, which was broadcast on live television, shows Maduro look up mid-speech, while his wife Cilia Flores, who is standing behind him, flinches.For a few seconds, no one appears to react, as they seem to be processing what\u2019s happened.\"Seconds later, there was a second explosion,\" Maduro said in a national address recounting the incident.Then the crowd disperses and people flee.Some images on Twitter capture the chaos and aftermath.Quisieron poner a prueba lealtades-de la Fuerza Armada y del pueblo sobre todo- y ya ven que somos infranqueables a la hora de defender nuestro proceso revolucionario y a nuestro l\u00edder @NicolasMaduro El fascismo No pasar\u00e1.pic.twitter.com/Nsa0fY4fOc\u2014 freddy \u00f1a\u00f1ez (@luchaalmada) August 5, 2018Seven members of the National Guard were harmed in the attack, Information Minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said at a press conference after the incident.He added that Maduro was unharmed and in a \"perfect state of health.\"\"This was an attempt to kill me,\" Maduro later said in a retelling of what happened.\"Today they attempted to assassinate me.\"Firefighters at the scene disputed that account, however, telling the Associated Press that a gas tank had exploded nearby.Maduro, 55, said he believed the attempted attack was part of a right-wing plot against him that was working with opponents in Bogot\u00e1 and Miami, including Santos, the outgoing Colombian president.He provided no evidence to back up his accusations.The Colombian government called Maduro\u2019s charges \"absurd.\"Other countries expressed support for Maduro after the attack, including Turkey, Syria, Nicaragua, and Russia.Bolivian President Evo Morales in a series of tweets expressed solidarity with Maduro and described the attempt as a \"crime against humanity.\"A little-known group called Soldiers in T-Shirts claimed responsibility for the act, saying they planned to fly two drones at the president but the devices were shot down.The AP couldn\u2019t verify the claims, and the group didn\u2019t respond to a message from the outlet when it reached out for comment.National Security Adviser John Bolton said in an appearance onFox News Sundaythat the United States had \"no involvement\" in the incident.\"If the government of Venezuela has hard information that they want to present to us that would show a potential violation of US criminal law, we\u2019ll take a serious look at it, but in the meantime I think what we really should focus on is the corruption and oppression in the Maduro regime in Venezuela,\" he said.The political situation in Venezuela is badMaduro, a former bus driver who took over as president after former President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez died in 2013, has overseen a catastrophic economic collapse in Venezuela.The socialist economy, once thriving, has spiraled since global oil prices dropped in 2014.Venezuelans suffer from widespread food and medicine shortages, and the majority of the country is living in poverty.Seventy-five percent of the country\u2019s population lost an average of 19 pounds of bodyweight between 2015 and 2016, and the International Monetary Fund expects inflation in Venezuela to reach 13,000 percent in 2018.Thousands of Venezuelans are fleeing the country.Yet Maduro remains in power.He won reelection in May due to a largely rigged election.He banned two of the most popular opposition leaders, Leopoldo Lopez and Henrique Capriles, from running against him, and implied that any Venezuelans who didn\u2019t vote for him could lose government food subsidies.His election is likely to worsen the economic crisis in Venezuela: Instead of electing a reformer who might enact the measures necessary to pull the country out of the state it\u2019s in right now, such as addressing its currency exchange policy and diversifying the economy away from oil dependence, the country now has Maduro for another six years.And he remains defiant \u2014 in the face of opposition, or alleged assassination attempts.Update: Story updated with comments from John Bolton.", "events": [{"event_id": "K0C047Z5A-E1", "trigger": "attack", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "Who was the target of

Up to 2,200 people have been killed \u2013 of whom at least 400 were civilians \u2013 according to the Pakistan government.In Yemen, Emmerson's report says that as many as 58 civilians are thought to have been killed in attacks by UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles). \"While the fact that civilians have been killed or injured does not necessarily point to a violation of international humanitarian law, it undoubtedly raises issues of accountability and transparency,\" the study notes.Reaper UAVs, used by the RAF in Afghanistan, have a range of 3,700 miles (5,900 km), a maximum airspeed of 250 knots and can ascend to 15,300 metres (50,000 feet), the document explains. Their missions can last up to 18 hours.The Reaper carries three cameras as well as laser-guided bombs. Three communication networks relay information between the RAF ground station in the UK and the UAV: \"a secure internet-based chat function, a secure radio routed via satellite and a secure telephone system\".\"The United Kingdom has reported only one civilian casualty incident, in which four civilians were killed and two civilians injured in a remotely piloted aircraft strike by the Royal Air Force in Afghanistan on 25 March 2011,\" Emmerson's report states. An RAF inquiry found that \"the actions of the [ground] crew had been in accordance with the applicable rules of engagement\".The special rapporteur said that he was informed that during RAF operations in Afghanistan, targeting intelligence is \"thoroughly scrubbed\" to ensure accuracy before authorisation to proceed is given. RAF strikes, he points out, are accountable in the UK through the Ministry of Defence and parliament.By contrast, Emmerson criticises the CIA's involvement in US drone strikes for creating \"an almost insurmountable obstacle to transparency\". He adds: \"One consequence is that the United States has to date failed to reveal its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft in classified operations conducted in Pakistan and elsewhere.\"Recent prounouncments from Barack Obama, however, have stressed that \"before any strike is taken, there must be near-certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured\".Emmerson acknowledges that: \"If used in strict compliance with the principles of international humanitarian law, remotely piloted aircraft are capable of reducing the risk of civilian casualties in armed conflict by significantly improving the situational awareness of military commanders.\" But, he cautions, there is \"no clear international consensus\" on the laws controlling the deployment of drone strikes.The special rapporteur concludes by urging: \"the United States to further clarify its position on the legal and factual issues \u2026 to declassify, to the maximum extent possible, information relevant to its lethal extraterritorial counter-terrorism operations; and to release its own data on the level of civilian casualties inflicted through the use of remotely piloted aircraft, together with information on the evaluation methodology used.\"", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_10-E1", "trigger": "attacks", "manual": [{"question":

and explosive experts said yesterday, apparently was put together with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country.Experts now estimate that the bomb weighed about 1,000 pounds and that the chemicals to make it were bought for a little more than $400.Though a young chemical engineer was arrested yesterday in connection with the explosion, the experts say that such a bomb could have been made by almost anyone with the help of one of scores of manuals, obtainable in bookstores and libraries, that provide step-by-step instructions.\"It's very easy to make one of these things,\" said Edward M.Roy, an explosives expert at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in Socorro, N.M. \"I tell my students, a lot of explosives I can make in my wastebasket.\"A Jumble of ChemicalsFollowing the trail of Mohammed A. Salameh, the \ufb01rst suspect arrested in the bombing, investigators discovered a jumble of chemicals, chemistry implements and detonating materials stacked in a storage locker at 69 Mallory Avenue in Jersey City that they say may also have served as the bomb laboratory.The day before the explosion that killed at least \ufb01ve people and injured more than 1,000 others, Mr.Salameh and several other men made \"numerous trips\" to the locker, which Mr.Salameh had rented for $97 a month late last year, the authorities say.The suspects traveled in a yellow Ford van, the investigators say, which has been identi\ufb01ed as the vehicle that carried the explosive into the underground garage of the World Trade Center.A Thick PasteThe investigators and experts say that after mixing the three main chemicals -- nitric and sulfuric acids and urea, a common ingredient in fertilizers -- into a thick paste, the bombers are believed to have packed the material into half a dozen or so cardboard boxes.They simply loaded the boxes loosely into the van, without using a special container for them, the investigators believe, and drove across the Hudson River to the trade center.The bombers ignited their concoction, investigators believe, with several smaller nitroglycerine bombs, which themselves were touched off with the kind of blasting cap routinely used at construction and mining sites across the country.The blasting cap is the only ingredient in the deadly mix, the experts and law-enforcement of\ufb01cials say, that requires a license or permit for purchase, and most probably was stolen.Manuals Were FoundThe investigators said they found manuals for bomb making in one of the apartments that they raided after arresting Mr.Salameh.Neil C.Livingstone, the president of the Institute on Terrorism and Sub-National Con\ufb02ict in Washington, said that as a test of how easy it was to obtain such guides to destruction, he recently wrote to a publishing house using a child's lined notepad and a crayon.Three of the bomb-making manuals were promptly delivered to the address Mr. Livingstone had given, he said, no questions asked.Though building the bomb was relatively easy, the experts say, it was not by any means free of danger.The bulkiest part of the bomb, they say, was extremely stable and could only have been touched off with a tremendous kick, like that provided by nitroglycerine.Making the nitroglycerine, by blending some of the chemicals, was the trickiest part of the process.As the chemicals are mixed to form this compound, said Dr. Per-Anders Persson, the director of the center for explosives research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology, they get hot and may explode.Often, he said, beakers are packed in dry ice to keep the chemicals at a safe temperature.A Dangerous MixThe nitroglycerine could have also exploded prematurely with any jolt or sharp change in temperature, the experts said.The bombers risked blowing themselves up as well, the experts said, when they hooked up the wires connecting the bomb's trigger with the blasting cap.Dr.Robert H. Kupperman, a senior adviser for science and technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies at Georgetown University, said that perhaps the greatest skill in making the bomb came in rigging the chain of triggering explosives so they all tore into the bulk of the bomb for maximum effect, as investigators at the World Trade Center say apparently happened.So far, in more than a week of searching, they have not found a single grain of the main explosive material.Sulfuric Acid Widely SoldWilliam Lazor, a senior technical consultant at the Du Pont Company in Wilmington, Del., said that sulfuric acid is the most widely sold chemical in the United States, used in the manufacture of everything from battery acid to detergents and shampoos.Dale Ladysh, another consultant at Du Pont, said that nitric acid is only slightly behind in popularity.It is used, he said, in the electronics industry and for making stainless steel and many industrial dies and pigmentations.Both acids are commonly used metal cleaners.According to Rick Amberg of Amberg Perennial Farm and Garden Center in West\ufb01eld, N.J., urea is often scattered over lawns to make them grow lustrously, and is also used in making plastics.Mr. Amberg sells a plastic 50-pound bag of urea for $20.99.In Newark, the Dooner & Smith Chemical Company sells a 15-gallon drum of sulfuric acid, weighing 172 pounds, for $41.28.The same size container of nitric acid costs $44 and weighs 220 pounds.\"Whoever put that thing together really intended to do a lot of damage,\" said Mr.Roy.\"This kind of explosive device is often used to fracture and move rock.It expands slowly with great force.\"", "events": [{"event_id": "JC002YBW2-E1", "trigger": "savaged", "manual": [{"question": "What was savaged?", "answer": "World Trade Center"}, {"question": "What savaged it?", "answer": "The bomb"}], "gpt": [{"question": "What was savaged?", "answer": "the World Trade Center"}, {"question": "Who or what savaged the World Trade Center?", "answer": "the bomb"}, {"question": "What was the bomb made of?", "answer": "ordinary chemicals"}, {"question": "Where can the chemicals to make the bomb be found?", "answer": "chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T75", "role": "ExplosiveDevice", "text": "bomb"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T30", "role": "Target", "text": "World Trade Center"}]}, {"event_id": "JC002YBW2-E2", "trigger": "put together", "manual": [{"question": "What was put together?", "answer": "the bomb"}, {"question": "What was it put together with?", "answer": "ordinary chemicals"}, {"question": "How much was it put together for?", "answer": "a little more than $400"}, {"question": "Who was it put together by?", "answer": "almost anyone"}], "gpt": [{"question": "What was put together?", "answer": "the bomb"}, {"question": "Who put it together?", "answer": "unknown/young chemical engineer (not specified in the passage)"}, {"question": "How was the bomb put together?", "answer": "with ordinary chemicals that are widely and cheaply available at chemical supply houses and gardening centers throughout the country"}, {"question": "How much did the chemicals cost?", "answer": "a little more than $400"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T17", "role": "Components", "text": "chemicals"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T75", "role": "Artifact", "text": "bomb"}]}, {"event_id": "JC002YBW2-E3", "trigger": "bought", "manual": [{"question": "What was bought?", "answer": "chemicals to make it"}, {"question": "How much was it bought for?", "answer": "a little more than $400"}], "gpt": [{"question": "What was bought?", "answer": "chemicals"}, {"question": "Who bought the chemicals?", "answer": "not specified"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T44", "role": "AcquiredEntity", "text": "chemicals"}, {"entity_id": "JC002YBW2-T181", "role": "PaymentBarter", "text": "$400"}]}, {"event_id": "JC002YBW2-E4", "trigger": "arrested", "manual": [{"question": "Who is arrested?", "answer": "Mohammed A.

school was ultimately thwarted when concerned classmates notified faculty and a school resource officer of the boy\u2019s \u201csuspicious\u201d backpack that had smoke coming out, cops said.The suspect was arrested after the school was evacuated and authorities, including the bomb squad and FBI, investigated.\u201cBased on our investigation we can confirm this was a failed attempt to detonate a homemade explosive at the school,\u201d the St. George Police Department said, adding that after examining the explosive device \u201cbomb squad members indicted that if it had detonated; the device had the potential to cause significant injury or death.\u201dThe department noted that \u201cit was also determined that the male had been researching information and expressing interest in ISIS and promoting the organization.\u201dAuthorities said additional charges may be brought.The teen is also being eyed as a suspect who raised the Islamic State group\u2019s flag on a pole at another Utah high school last month \u2014 one day after the deadly Valentine\u2019s Day shooting rampage at a Florida high school.Police Officer Ken Thompson told the Associated Press that when the

incident at the high school and no property was damaged.Washington County School District spokesman Steve Dunham said: \u201cI think it is a shock to all of us that something like this has happened in one of our schools.\u201dThe police department hailed the students who notified faculty of the smoking backpack.\u201cTheir immediate action played a large role in this incident ending with no

That sentence is the maximum agreed to when Kadyrbayev pleaded guilty last year to impeding the bombing investigation.Kadyrbayev is being sentenced June 2. A message seeking comment from his attorney wasn't immediately returned Wednesday.Prosecutors said there's no evidence Kadyrbayev knew about the plot to detonate two pressure cooker bombs loaded with shrapnel near the marathon's finish line. They said he recognized Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's photo when authorities released it and he removed Tsarnaev's laptop and backpack from his dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth.\"Had the defendant done the right thing, and called the police,\" Rogers said, \"the Tsarnaev brothers' murderous rampage across Cambridge and Watertown may have been prevented.\"Tsarnaev's lawyers acknowledged his role in the deadly bombings, and he was convicted of many criminal charges. A jury last month sentenced him to death.Two more of his friends -- Azamat Tazhayakov and Robel Phillipos -- have been convicted of impeding the investigation.

was placed on a counterterrorism list in late 2011.The officials say the CIA asked that Tamerlan Tsarnaev's name be placed on the list after it was contacted by the Russian government with its concerns that he had become a radical Islamist. Moscow also issued a similar warning to the FBI on Tamerlan Tsarnaev earlier in 2011. Officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.Information sharing U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the April 15 twin bombings that left three people dead and 264 others injured - including at least 14 who lost limbs. Authorities will brief the full U.S. Senate on the investigation into the bombing.Investigators say Tamerlan, 26, and his brother Dzhokar, 19, placed the bombs near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. Tamerlan was killed in a shootout with police last Thursday, while Dzhokhar was captured a day later.Dzhokhar has been charged with using a weapon of mass destruction. He is in federal custody in a Boston hospital.Russia visit Several months after he first came to the attention of U.S. federal agents, Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. in January 2012 for a six-month visit to Russia. When he returned, his name generated an alert by a screening system used by U.S. Customs agents. But Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said the FBI told him it was not aware at the time of Tsarnaev's trip to Russia.U.S. investigators have questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists during his 2012 visit. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia for decades. Memorial service U.S. Vice President Joe Biden denounced the suspects Wednesday in Boston. Biden spoke at a memorial service for a university police officer allegedly gunned down by the suspects just days after the bombings. \"Why, whether it\u2019s al-Qaida central ... or two twisted, perverted, cowardly, knock-off jihadists here in Boston. Why do they do what they do?\u201d he asked.Several thousand mourners gathered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to remember the slain policeman, Sean Collier. Biden said the United States must keep its values in the face of threats from terrorists.Boston authorities on Wednesday reopened Boylston Street to the public.

The older of the alleged Marathon bombers, Tamarlan Tsarnaev, started attending Friday prayers at the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge, about a year-and-a-half ago.Anwar Kazmi, a member of the executive board of the Islamic Society of Boston, addresses reporters Monday. (Fred Thys/WBUR)Tsarnaev called attention to himself during one prayer service earlier this year. It happened on Jan. 18 \u2014 the Friday prayers just before Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.\"The theme of the sermon was about great men like Dr. Martin Luther King, like the prophet, what drove them, their sense of mission, what we could learn from their lives and how we could be inspired by their example, and so when the person who was giving the sermon began to talk about King, [Tsarnaev] got up and objected and raised his voice, which is against the etiquette of the sermon,\" Anwar Kazmi, a board member of the Islamic Society of Boston Trust, told reporters Monday in front of the small mosque on busy Prospect Street in Cambridge.Kazmi said different people have different memories of what Tsarnaev said that day. Kazmi said some people reported Tsarnaev objected to comparing King to the prophet Mohammed. Others have reported he called the speaker a hypocrite. Kazmi said after the incident, people sat down with Tsarnaev and explained to him that he could not interrupt the sermon.\"And he seemed to understand and nothing happened after that,\" Kazmi said. \"He continued to come to the mosque even after the incident.\"Kazmi said one man remembers a positive experience with Tsarnaev. The man ran out of gas, and Tsarnaev ran over to his apartment, got a gas can, filled it up, and brought it to the man.Kazmi said Tsarnaev's younger brother, Dzhokhar, only came once to Friday prayers.\"And I have been told that on occasion, they would also come here for the dawn prayers, and that the younger one sometimes came accompanied by his older brother,\" Kazmi said. \"The younger one never came here by himself.\"Kazmi said several members of the congregation are still being interviewed by the FBI about the brothers.

confiscated.According to the complaint, Yamamoto, a resident of Obama, Fukui Prefecture, flew the drone out of a parking lot near the Prime Minister\u2019s Office in Chiyoda Ward on April 9 and intentionally landed it on the roof of the government building.The drone, equipped with flares and a container filled with radioactive soil and affixed with a radiation sticker, was discovered by officials nearly two weeks later on April 22.Although his action did not endanger anyone, his intention to interrupt official duties at the office was clear, Tanabe said in handing down the sentence.Yamamoto had pleaded not guilty. His lawyers said he intended to challenge the Abe administration\u2019s policy on nuclear energy, and that as a form of protest the move did not break any laws.Prosecutors had demanded a three-year prison term for Yamamoto as well as the confiscation of his drone. They said his actions were premeditated and clearly intended to interfere with official duties.An expressionless Yamamoto, who appeared at the court in a gray sweatshirt and sweatpants, sat with his head down as the sentence was read out.The incident ignited a heated discussion about the need for regulations for drones.In September, the government revised the Aviation Law to set the first restrictions on how to operate drones.The law, which has been in effect since December, bans drones from areas near airports and above densely populated areas, including all 23 wards in central Tokyo, unless granted government permission. Violators can face a fine of up to \u00a5500,000.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_1_news_3-E1", "trigger": "sentenced", "manual": [{"question": "Who was sentanced", "answer": "Yasuo

{"text": "Venezuela crisis: Maduro to raise fuel prices to combat smugglingVenezuela\u2019s heavily subsidised domestic fuel prices should rise to international levels to avoid billions of dollars in annual losses as a result of smuggling, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has said in a televised address.\"Gasoline must be sold at an international price to stop smuggling to Colombia and the Caribbean,\" the president said.Like most oil-producing countries, Venezuela has for decades subsidised fuel as a benefit to consumers.But its fuel prices have remained nearly flat for years despite hyperinflation that the International Monetary Fund has projected would reach 1 million per cent this year.That means that for the price of a cup of coffee, a driver can fill the tank of a small SUV nearly 9,000 times.Recently, the average price of a coffee with milk was 2.2m bolivars, or about 50 cents, local media has reported.Smugglers do brisk business reselling fuel in neighbouring countries.Quick guideWhy is Venezuela in crisis?Show Hide Under the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who ushered in Venezuela\u2019s socialist revolution in 1999, a new constitution and numerous elections placed nearly all government institutions under the control of the ruling Socialist party.This concentration of power was aided by a feuding opposition which carried out ineffectual campaigns and electoral boycotts.After Ch\u00e1vez died of cancer in 2013, he was succeeded by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who is even less tolerant of dissent.Growing political authoritarianism has coincided with greater state dominance over the economy.But expropriations, price controls and mismanagement have led to a 40% contraction of the economy in the past five years.Oil accounts for 96% of Venezuela\u2019s export income but many foreign companies have been driven out and production has dropped to a 30-year low.The resulting fiscal crisis has prompted the government to print more money, which has led to hyperinflation and a collapse of the currency.It also means that the government can\u2019t import enough food and medicine to meet demand.Maduro has rejected economic reforms out of loyalty to socialism and because many government officials are allegedly getting rich off the economic distortions \u2013 through exchange rate scams and by selling scarce food on the black market.Was this helpful?Thank you for your feedback.Maduro said the government would still provide direct subsidies to citizens holding the \"fatherland card\", a state-issued identification card that the government uses to provide bonuses and track use of social services.He said the subsidy was only available to those who registered their cars in a vehicle census being conducted by the state.Venezuela has dirt-cheap fuel, so why is driving nearly impossible?Read moreOn Friday, the UN said that more than half a million Venezuelans had crossed into Ecuador this year as part of one of the largest mass migrations in Latin American history.About 547,000 citizens have entered Ecuador since January \u2013 mostly through its northern border with Colombia \u2013 to escape rampant crime and political violence, a collapsing economy and severe shortages of food and medicines.More than 1 million Venezuelans have also crossed into Colombia since the exodus began in 2015.Others have fanned out across Latin American and Caribbean nations including Mexico, the Dominican Republic and Trindad and Tobago.Tens of thousands have hiked into Brazil down a remote Amazon road known as the Hunger Highway.",

trying to ignite explosives aboard an American Airlines jet could be one of many suicide recruits from London, according to the chairman of a Brixton mosque where the suspect worshipped.Abdul Haqq

succeed where he failed.\"I think now they've seen that this particular plan was foiled, the others I fear, are going to be more successful and more extreme in what they do,\" Baker said.\"I really

1998, at about the same time as Zacarias Moussaoui, who has been indicted in the U.S. on conspiracy charges related to the Sept. 11 hijackings.Moussaoui is a French citizen accused of being trained as the \"20th hijacker\" for the attacks on the Pentagon and New York's World Trade Center.Baker says Reid, believed to be of Anglo-Jamaican heritage, had converted to Islam while serving time in jail for minor offences and attended the mosque for two years.Reid is accused of trying to detonate C-4 plastic explosives hidden in his shoes on a flight from Paris to Miami last Saturday. A flight attendant said she noticed the smell of smoke, then saw a man trying to light one of his shoes with a match.The plane, with nearly 200 people on board, was diverted to Boston's Logan

Yes that's right you know if you look back a year ago the first bomb actually went off on March 2 but we did not know this was a serial bomber.

ABC's Josh mar goal until seemed we're just learning. How scared east cops war. Law enforcement is terrified by what they're watching and they're watching an escalation they were very very clear that they didn't know was happening he was clearly getting more sophisticated.

Is one that is put into this shipping or package delivery system because. That's the place you're putting a bomb on a plane as a V didn't want to admitted at the time because he'd want to cause a panic but they saw packages ready for shipping day had a hunch and the fear that his next step would be to put it into the shipping system at the end it was exactly that it. He's gonna tell me just how close the suspect was to getting away in remember Austin sits on an interstate highway Hulk it's perfect for getaways. Meaning this really was a race against time.

Prosecutors say McVeigh took a cab because his car was parked near the federal building in Oklahoma City, waiting to serve as his getaway.David D\u2019Albini, who was manager of the McDonald\u2019s at the time, identified still pictures from the tape as McVeigh at the counter buying a fruit pie and later walking through the dining area.``It\u2019s him, isn\u2019t it, there\u2019s no doubt in your mind?\u2033 McVeigh attorney Stephen Jones asked.``Yes,\u2033 D\u2019Albini replied.Prosecutors say McVeigh spent eight minutes in the restaurant and then made a 15-minute walk to Elliott\u2019s Body Shop to rent the truck that exploded April 19, 1995, outside an Oklahoma City federal building, killing 168 people.Authorities traced the bomb-carrying truck to Elliott\u2019s through a vehicle identification number on a truck axle found in the bombing debris. The truck matching that number was rented April 17, 1995, at Elliott\u2019s by a man using the name Robert Kling.Earlier Friday, prosecutors called a Chinese restaurant owner to link McVeigh to the Kling name.Yuhua Bai, the owner of the Hunan Palace in Junction City, testified that a food order was sent to the Dreamland Motel room where McVeigh stayed the week before the bombing and the name given was Robert Kling.Bai said she took the phone order for moo goo gai pan and egg rolls from a man using the name Kling on April 15, 1995, four days before the bombing. Bai, a Chinese immigrant, recalled commenting to the man about his last name.She said it sounded ``like a Chinese name.\u2033Under cross-examination, Ms. Bai admitted she did not know who ordered the food or took delivery. She said the delivery man did not get a good look at the man.Later, Marife Nicholas, the wife of McVeigh\u2019s alleged conspirator Terry Nichols, testified her husband got a telephone call during Easter dinner, three days before the blast, and left the house abruptly, returning the following day.During that time, prosecutors allege Nichols drove to Oklahoma City to pick up McVeigh, who had stashed a getaway car near the bombing site.McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veteran, could get the death penalty if convicted of murder and conspiracy in the bombing, the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S. soil.

He spoke Arabic intermittently during his statement, and then translated for the court.He was also convicted of attempted murder of US officers or employees, and four counts of possessing a weapon in furtherance of a federal crime of violence.Abdo told police in a recorded interview he planned the attack \"because I don't appreciate what my unit did in Afghanistan\".According to authorities, he intended to set off a bomb in a Chinese restaurant popular with Fort Hood soldiers and their families. Then Abdo planned to wait outside and shoot any survivors.He believed he would become a martyr when police killed him, they added.Abdo referred to Maj Nidal Hasan, an army psychiatrist accused of killing 13 people in a 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, and told the court he remained in the accused's shadow despite \"efforts to outdo him\".", "events": [{"event_id": "scenario_en_kairos_54-E1",

terrorism and public safety. While the effects of the bombing are well-documented, not as much attention has been paid to the motivations of the bomber, Timothy McVeigh. He was spurred to action by the events of the Waco siege, where the FBI engaged in a 51-day standoff with the Branch Davidians, a small religious group suspected of owning illegal weapons. However, this was not the first incident that inspired his later actions. In 1992, the Weaver family entered into their own standoff against federal agents, after Randy Weaver failed to show up to court on illegal weapons charges. Over the course of the standoff, his wife, Vicki Weaver, and twelve-year-old son Samuel were killed. Both Waco and Ruby Ridge galvanized the far right, who saw it as the government using deadly force against their own citizens, who merely wished to live their lives as they saw fit. McVeigh was further influenced by The Turner Diaries, a novel in which the protagonist blows up a government building as a part of a revolution against the government. These three factors are analyzed in regards to the influence they had on McVeigh\u2019s decision to attack the Murrah building.", "events": [{"event_id": "scenario_en_kairos_21-E1", "trigger": "bombing", "manual": [{"question": "What was the event that happened on April 19, 1995?", "answer": "Oklahoma City bombing\n"}, {"question": "Who was the bomber?", "answer": "Timothy McVeigh"}, {"question": "What motivated Timothy McVeigh to bomb Oklahoma City?", "answer": "the events of the Waco siege"}, {"question": "What topic of the bombing wasn't paid attention to?

He\u2019s a slacker. He\u2019s bright. He\u2019s a victim of culture shock, a broken family and a domineering older brother. He\u2019s a murderer. He\u2019s a terrorist.That\u2019s the picture presented in recent days of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as his defense lawyers neared the end of their effort to save their client\u2019s life. As early as Monday, the defense may rest their case and put their faith in the 12-person jury, which will decide whether he should die or live.Tsarnaev, 21, was convicted last month of 30 terrorism and other related charges for his role in the April 2013 Boston Marathon bombing. U.S. law requires that the jury must return a unanimous decision in order to execute a person, and it is that chance \u2013 that one juror will decide against the death penalty \u2013 where Tsarnaev\u2019s lawyers are placing their hopes.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, shown in January 2007, holding the daughter of his grade school teacherThree people died in the attack, including an 8-year-old boy, and more than 260 were wounded. Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, killed a police officer several days later just prior to a car chase and shootout that left Tamerlan dead.Penalty PhaseThe two-part trial entered the \u201cpenalty\u201d phase April 21, as prosecutors sought to paint Tsarnaev as a willing accomplice in the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil since Sept. 11, 2001.Defense lawyers portrayed their client as a malleable participant, under the sway of Tamerlan, who they said was the mastermind and leader.\u201cThe whole goal of the defense is \u2026 to make the jury see the defendant as a vulnerable human being,\u201d said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Washington-based Death Penalty Information Center.\u201cThe jury doesn\u2019t have to like him,\u201d he said. \u201cThe jury doesn\u2019t have to want to have him over to their house for dinner. They just have to decide that putting him away in a dark hole for the rest of his life is an acceptable punishment.\u201dAs with the previous phase, the courtroom has been whipsawed by testimony, by turns infuriating, wrenching, maddening or saddening.Prosecutors stunned spectators and jurors in their opening arguments for the death penalty by juxtaposing photographs: of the youngest victim, 8-year-old Martin Richard, and that of Tsarnaev, making an obscene gesture to a video camera in the prison cell where he\u2019s being held.\u201cThis is Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, unconcerned, unrepentant and unchanged,\u201d federal prosecutor Nadine Pellegrini told jurors.Courtroom TearsOn Monday, less than two weeks later, the courtroom filled with sobbing, when Tsarnaev\u2019s aunt, Patimat Suleimanova, flown from Russia, wracked with tears, tried to speak about her nephew whom she hadn\u2019t seen in more than a decade.During the weeks that the trial has been ongoing, Tsarnaev, who spent his childhood shuttling between Russia and Kyrgyzstan and then his formative years in a three-bedroom, third-floor apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been largely impassive and at times appearing bored.On Monday, after listening to his aunt, he himself broke down for the first time, rubbing his eyes with his fists and openly weeping.Not long after, as he was being led from the courtroom during a break, he blew a kiss to a cousin who was in attendance.South Boston resident Joe Kebartas, holding a sign reading \"Death Penalty is Murder,\" demonstrates outside the federal courthouse where Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has been convicted on all 30 counts, April 8, 2015.More than 40 witnesses appeared during the penalty phase, including some of Tsarnaev\u2019s former school teachers and college friends, some crying openly. During her appeareance in court on April 29, one former teacher, Becki Norris, smiled at Tsarnaev, and he returned the smile.Later, she posted a photograph on Facebook of 12-year-old Tsarnaev holding her newborn daughter.\u201cWhen you care deeply for someone, that doesn't stop even if they do unfathomably horrible things. We humans are really good at holding two irreconcilable ideas in our psyches at the same time. Yes, he did the unforgivable. And yes, I still love him. And \u2013 this one is hard to fathom, I know \u2013 he still needs love,\u201d Norris wrote on her Facebook page.Death penalty decisionThe decision by the Obama administration to seek the death penalty for Tsarnaev has been controversial. Massachusetts state law does not allow for capital punishment, but Tsarnaev is being tried in federal court.Support for the death penalty in the state has never been strong, and public opinion polls taken by Boston-area media in the months prior to and during the trial have shown dwindling enthusiasm.On the eve of the final phase, the Boston Globe published a front-page letter from Martin Richard\u2019s family, in which they called for sentencing Tsarnaev to life in prison.This undated photo provided by Bill Richard shows his son, Martin Richard, who was among the at least three people killed in the explosions at the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Apr. 15, 2013.\u201cAs long as the defendant is in the spotlight, we have no choice but to live a story told on his terms, not ours,\u201d the family wrote. \u201cThe minute the defendant fades from our newspapers and TV screens is the minute we begin the process of rebuilding our lives and our family.\u201dAt the beginning of Tsarnaev\u2019s trial, his defense, led by renowned lawyer Judy Clarke, conceded his guilt, in what appeared to be a strategy focused more on saving his life. \u201cThis is the theory: that no person is only the worse thing they\u2019ve done in their life,\u201d said Quin Denvir, a former federal defender who worked with Clarke in gaining a life prison sentence for Theodore Kaczynski, the \u201cUnabomber,\u201d in a federal trial in 1998.\u201cIt\u2019s all part of letting the jury seeing the person as a human being, not just the perpetrator of a crime, but as a fully developed human being, with strengths and weaknesses,\u201d Denvir said.In addition to calling relatives and experts on Chechnya\u2019s tortured history, lawyers have called witnesses to argue that the prison where Tsarnaev would live out the rest of his life \u2013 the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Colorado \u2013 would be harsh and unforgiving.It is \u201ca mechanism to cut off an inmate\u2019s communications with the outside world,\u201d defense witness Mark Bezy testified on Wednesday.Tsarnaev\u2019s parents, Anzor and Zubeidat, were not called to testify. Both now live in Dagestan, the Russian region bordering Chechnya, and have not returned the United States since just after Tsarnaev\u2019s initial court appearance in 2013.Russian Hunger For NewsWith the Tsarnaev family\u2019s ties to Russia and the North Caucasus, there\u2019s been intense interest in the trial for many Russians, according to Alexei Venediktov, the editor-in-chief of Ekho Moskvy, an influential, independent radio station and Web site in Moscow.The proceedings, however, have received virtually no coverage in the Russian news media, nearly all of which is state-controlled. Venediktov told VOA that\u2019s probably because of growing concern from the Kremlin about stability in the long-troubled North Caucasus.\u201cThis process carries an unpleasant association, I think, for the leadership, in particular, of the Russian Federation, and therefore, I think, it\u2019s possible there\u2019s been embargo on news,\u201d he said. He also said support is growing in Russia to bring back the death penalty, and were the Boston jury to sentence him to death, it would have a significant impact on the Russian debate.\u201cI think the jury\u2019s verdict will be actively discussed in Russia if it ends up being the death penalty,\u201d he said.Tlisova reported from Boston; Eckel reported from Washington.

Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, on April 19, 1995, was, at the time, the most significant act of terrorism that had ever taken place in the United States. Government agencies, led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), immediately began an extensive investigation to identify and prosecute the culprits. The investigation, known as OKBOMB, was run by a Task Force that consisted primarily of FBI investigators and support personnel and Department of Justice prosecutors. Within a few months, three individuals-Timothy McVeigh, Terry Nichols, and Michael Fortier-were indicted for crimes relating to the bombing. McVeigh and Nichols were convicted after trials, and Fortier pled guilty as part of a plea agreement with the government. McVeigh, who had devised the plot to bomb the Murrah Building and had planted the bomb, was sentenced to death. On May 8, 2001, one week before McVeigh's scheduled execution date, the Department of Justice and the FBI revealed to McVeigh's and Nichols' attorneys that over 700 investigative documents had not been disclosed to the defendants before their trials. The government acknowledged that it had violated a discovery order in the case, and the Attorney General stayed McVeigh's execution for one month in order to resolve the legal issues arising from the belated disclosure. Following the public revelation of the problem, and after finding and releasing more than 300 additional OKBOMB documents to the defense, the FBI came under severe criticism for its handling of the OKBOMB documents.\"United States.

second-generation trooper, was responding to multiple cars that had slid off the road in the canyon.The trooper was walking toward a stranded white car when he was hit from behind by a black runaway car that was sliding.When Brenchley was hit, the video shows him launched into the air before landing beside the white car.On Tuesday, Brenchley spoke to the media for the first time since he was hit.\"I am extremely grateful to be alive ,\" he said.Brenchley suffered broken ribs and a broken scapula.He was transported to the Logan Regional Hospital.\"I remember thinking to myself, I\u2019ve been hit.Holy crap, I\u2019ve been hit,\" Brenchley said.His wife and four children joined him during the press conference.They said they are extremely grateful he is okay.\"It could have taken me

He made his initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Judge Mary Milloy this morning, at which time he was temporarily ordered into custody upon the government\u2019s request pending a detention hearing set for Thursday, Aug. 24 at 2:00 p.m.According to the complaint, on the evening of Aug. 19, 2017, a Houston park ranger observed Schneck kneeling among the bushes in front of the General Dowling Monument located in Hermann Park in Houston. Schneck was allegedly holding two small boxes with various items inside to include what appeared to be duct tape and wires. After placing the boxes on the ground per the ranger\u2019s request, Schneck then allegedly took a drink from plastic bottle but immediately spit it on the ground. The ranger then noticed a timer and wires in the box and notified the Houston Police Department (HPD), according to the complaint.The clear liquid was field tested as was a white powdery substance found in a small, black aluminum tube which revealed they were most likely nitroglycerin and Hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD), respectively, according to the charges. HMTD is a high explosive organic compound used as an initiating, or primary explosive. Nitroglycerin has been used as an active ingredient in the manufacture of explosives. ln its pure form, nitroglycerin is a contact explosive, with physical shock causing it to explode, which degrades over time to even more unstable forms.

There was no information about how the four men might be involved in the attack.British interior minister Amber Rudd said Wednesday the suicide bomber, who has been identified as Salman Abedi, 22, was \"known\" by British intelligence services before the bombing.She also told the BBC that \"it seems likely, possible, that he wasn't doing this on his own.\"The blast at the conclusion of a concert by American pop star Ariana Grande at Manchester Arena killed 22 people and wounded 59 others. The attacker also died at the site.Police officers arrive at a residential property on Elsmore Road in Fallowfield, Manchester, on May 24, 2017, as investigations continue into the May 22 terror attack at the Manchester Arena.Investigation shifts to Abedi's activitiesInvestigators are now trying to figure out what Abedi was up to in his last days before the attack Monday.French Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told BFM television on Wednesday that British and French intelligence have information that Abedi had likely traveled to Syria.According to Collomb, Abedi \u201cgrew up in Britain and then suddenly, after a trip to Libya and then likely to Syria, became radicalized and decided to carry out this attack.\u201d\"In any case, the links with Daesh (Islamic State) are proven,\" he said.Islamic State is claiming it was behind the attack, but neither British nor U.S. intelligence have confirmed that.Police officers stand guard in central Manchester, Britain, May 24, 2017 after Monday's suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert.Terror level raised Britain raised its terrorism alert level to critical \u2013 the highest step \u2013 after the blast, signaling that another attack was highly likely and could be imminent.The change is most visible in the deployment of soldiers to help guard certain areas, including major events such as concerts and football matches, in order to free up police officers.Hopkins said an off-duty police officer was among those killed in the suicide attack, but it will take up to five days for authorities to identify all the victims.\u201cDue to number of victims the Home Office post-mortems are likely to take four to five days. After this we will be in a position to formerly name the victims,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have spoken to all of the families of those who lay injured in our hospitals.\u201dBritish Prime Minister Theresa May said in an address to the nation late Tuesday that authorities will do everything possible to protect the public and asked people to remain vigilant.\"I do not want the public to feel unduly alarmed. We have faced a serious terrorist threat in our country for many years,\" May said.People attend a vigil in Albert Square, Manchester, England, May 23, 2017, the day after the suicide attack at an Ariana Grande concert that left 22 people dead as it ended on Monday night.Maximum carnage Earlier in the day, she spoke more directly about the attack itself, saying the bomber chose the \"time and place to cause maximum carnage and to kill and injure indiscriminately.\"Many of the victims were young girls, with the youngest identified so far being just 8-year-old.Video from the arena showed the joy in the audience at the end of the concert turning to confusion and then to panic and a scramble to get out of the building as the realization of what just happened spread.Witness say they saw blood covered bodies on the floor while others, badly wounded, staggered toward the exits of the building.The scene outside the concert hall was also chaotic, with traffic snarled and parents rushing to the scene.Britain's Queen Elizabeth held a moment of silence at a garden party at Buckingham Palace.

2002 \"Sunday 21 July marks the 30th anniversary of an IRA operation in Belfast in 1972 which resulted in nine people being killed and many more injured. While it was not our intention to injure or kill non-combatants, the reality is that on this and on a number of other occasions, that was the consequence of our actions. It is therefore appropriate on the anniversary of this tragic event, that we address all of the deaths and injuries of non-combatants caused by us. We offer our sincere apologies and condolences to their families. There have been fatalities amongst combatants on all sides. We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives. The future will not be found in denying collective failures and mistakes or closing minds and hearts to the plight of those who have been hurt. That includes all of the victims of the conflict, combatants and non-combatants. It will not be achieved by creating a hierarchy of victims in which some are deemed more or less worthy than others. The process of conflict resolution requires the equal acknowledgement of the grief and loss of others. On this anniversary, we are endeavouring to fulfil this responsibility to those we have hurt. The IRA is committed unequivocally to the search for freedom, justice and peace in Ireland. We remain totally committed to the peace process and to dealing with the challenges and difficulties which this presents. This includes the acceptance of past mistakes and of the hurt and pain we have caused to others.\" P O'Neill, Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin.The statement from the IRA was received by An Phoblacht (Republican News) on Tuesday, 16 July:", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_1-E1", "trigger": "killed", "manual": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "nine people"}, {"question": "When were they killed?", "answer": "Sunday 21 July, 1972"}, {"question": "Who killed them?", "answer": "IRA"}, {"question": "Was it the intention of the IRA to kill non-combatants?", "answer": " it was not (their) intention to injure or kill non-combatants"}], "gpt": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "nine people"}, {"question": "When were they killed?", "answer": "Sunday 21 July, 1972"}, {"question": "Who killed them?", "answer": "IRA"}, {"question": "Was it the intention of the IRA to kill non-combatants?", "answer": "\"While it was not our intention to injure or kill non-combatants\""}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_1-T9", "role": "Victim", "text": "people"}]}, {"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_1-E2", "trigger": "injured", "manual": [{"question": "Who was injured?", "answer": "non-combatants"}, {"question": "How were they injured?", "answer": "as a consequence of IRA's actions"}, {"question": "When did the injury occur?", "answer": "Sunday 21 July"}, {"question": "Were the injuries intentional?

my mummy had died listening to my daddy crying and calling for her.\"These are the words of Pat Arthus who was just 14-years-old when a loyalist bomb ripped through a bar in a Catholic area of Belfast and killed her mother.Fifteen people including men, women and children lost their lives in the explosion at The Tramore Bar - better known as McGurk's - in North Queen Street on 4 December 1971.It was one of worst atrocities in the history of the Troubles, but one which some families of the bereaved feel is largely forgotten about.PlayingPat Arthus remembers her mother, Kathleen Irvine, saying her prayers on the day of the explosion.Ironically, Mrs Irvine and other local women went to a grotto every day to pray for peace.Pat was playing out in the street when the bomb went off.\"I remember running down to the scene. It was just completely flattened,\" she said.\"People just came from everywhere. They were on their hands and knees. They were passing the rubble one by one. They were in a big line.\"You heard them shouting: 'There's one, there's one'.\"It was just total chaos. Soldiers threw their guns down on the ground to help the people from the New Lodge Road dig.\"Later, she went home and found her grandmother in the house crying, after learning that Pat's mother and father had been caught up in the bomb.Her father was seriously injured in the blast.\"After that was like a total blur, because people were coming in and out of the house,\" she said.\"There were that many different stories being told.\"My granny gave me and my brother wee jobs to do about the house. To go in and make the tea, tidy up, to try and keep us busy.\"But you were hearing people saying things like they were bringing people out in black bags. It was terrible, it really was.\"'Own goal'She also recalled the pain of seeing her father, who has since died, cope with the loss of his wife.\"I remember my granny, she was 80-odd years of age, going into him,\" she said.\"When I looked into the room she was cradling her son in her arms. 'It's all right Johnny,' she said. 'It's all right'.\"This seemed to go on every night, where he cried and he relived the whole explosion. It was a very sad time.\"Some reports at the time suggested the bar was frequented by political activists, that the bomb belonged to an IRA team in transit and was a republican 'own-goal'.But this was rubbished as \"ridiculous\" by local residents.Pat said: \"You were saying to yourself: 'Who killed my mummy? Why did my own people kill my mummy?\"At the back of your mind you knew it wasn't our own people that had done it.\"This was a family-run bar and it was people like my mummy and daddy that went to talk with each other and just pass the time of day for a pint or an orange and then come home again.\"Seven years after the bomb, a UVF man received 15 life sentences after he was convicted of the bombing.On Tuesday night a number of events are being held to mark the 30th anniverary of the atrocity.1900 GMT Mass at St Patrick's Chapel, Donegall Street.

The socialist \"revolution\" against democracy and free markets is proceeding in Venezuela, with the authoritarian government downplaying a mysterious disease outbreak as print media in the country slowly dies off.As reported by WPLG'sin Miami, there have been at least 10 deaths from the as-yet-unidentified disease. The deaths have occurred in several Venezuelan cities, including the capital of Caracas. As it spreads, the disease is creating panic among the population and has led some of the nation's physicians to sound the alarm.However, as WPLG reported, the warnings are being downplayed by the socialist government:However, though the government remains in denial mode, doctors in Venezuela are taking the threat seriously; they say there is genuine reason for concern, especially in a country where government policies have created nightmarish shortages of everything from basic food supplies to medicines. Plus, they say the disease is both dangerous and contagious.\"We do not know what it is,\" Duglas Leon Natera, president of the Venezuelan Medical Federation, said, according to WPLG.At first, those infected present with a fever and spots on the skin, which then produce large blisters followed by internal and external bleeding, says data provided by the College of Physicians in the state of Aragua, where the first cases were seen.From that point, the disease progresses very quickly; patients begin suffering from respiratory failure, then kidney failure. And thus far, Venezuelan doctors have not been able to figure out what they are dealing with, let alone a treatment plan.And the government is hindering the process, largely by denying that there even is \"a mysterious disease ,\" because that's what dictatorial, socialist leaders do: claim infallibility and blame others. One official called the doctors' information nothing but a \"media campaign against Venezuela .\"And the governor of the state of Aragua, Tarek El-Aissami, along with Communications Minister Delcy Rodriguez, has labeled the warnings a \"defamatory\" strategy to \"distress to the population.\"Doctors are not completely in the dark; some have speculated on what the disease might be. Theories include a new type of very aggressive, severe dengue fever and a different version of Chikungunya fever; some have even suggested that it could be Ebola.Meanwhile, as its people die, so, too, does Venezuela's ability to inform its people; the country's print media is slowing dying too, suffering from a lack of newsprint, as WPLG reported:According to a newly released report by the Institute for Press and Society of Venezuela, or IPYS, 34 newspapers and magazines in 11 states have reported in the past year chronic shortages and difficulties acquiring supplies and other materials to print, such as ink, film and plates.The situation has been made worse by the government's strict controls on acquiring foreign exchange, as well as interference in the internal processes of suppliers.

That was certainly the case here on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Jan. 17, 2011.I shudder to think how different things would have been for us were it not for three temporary workers who were pulling a shift for the city\u2019s Public Utilities District: Mark Steiner, Brandon Klaus and Sherman Welpton.Ring a bell?

It had been placed along the route soon to be filled with marchers honoring the late civil rights leader. They could have just as easily ignored it, but they didn\u2019t.

Laced with rat poison, the weapon was designed to be detonated from as far as 1,000 feet away. Dozens could have died or been mutilated horribly.Harpham was sentenced to 32 years in prison, the maximum allowed under a plea bargain struck between Harpham\u2019s attorneys and prosecutors.That still doesn\u2019t seem like enough.It\u2019s easy to take for granted the things that don\u2019t happen, but watching the horrors unfold in Boston should drive home just how lucky we were.Limbs blown off.

It was a hot Saturday morning, the first weekend of Italy\u2019s traditional holiday month, and thousands of vacationers jostled their way to and from the trains in Bologna\u2019s central railroad station. In the midst of that noisy crowd someone stopped midway between the second-class waiting room and the coffee bar, put down a heavy suitcase, and quickly left the station. The suitcase contained over forty pounds of explosives, perhaps stable nitroglycerine, connected to a timer. At exactly 10:25 AM it exploded, ripping through the crowd, tearing apart the reinforced concrete walls, and bringing the roof crashing down on hundreds of bodies and parts of bodies.In the bloody aftermath, rescue squads worked for over twelve hours to pull the dead and maimed from the rubble. As they labored, a young neofascist entered a telephone booth across town and dialed Bologna\u2019s leading newspaper. \u201cThis is the Armed Revolutionary Nuclei,\u201d he said. \u201cWe claim responsibility for the explosion in the railway station.\u201d The final toll: eighty-five dead\u2014the eldest an eighty-six-year-old man, the youngest a three-year-old child\u2014and more than two hundred wounded.Eight weeks later, on the evening of September 26, a young man, Gundolf Koehler, tried to place six pounds of explosives in a refuse can at the entrance to Munich\u2019s Oktoberfest. The bomb went off, killing him and twelve others, wounding 215 people. On Koehler\u2019s body were found documents linking him to the illegal paramilitary Defense Sport Group of the neo-Nazi Karl-Heinz Hoffmann, who styles himself the \u201cspiritual descendant\u201d of Adolf Hitler and who has organized military maneuvers in southern Germany for his followers. Arrested along with twenty-four of his militants, Hoffmann was later released for lack of evidence.A week later in Paris a twenty-six pound bomb exploded in front of the rue Copernic synagogue, where hundreds of Jews were gathered for sabbath services. The bomb killed four persons and wounded thirteen; if it had gone off twenty minutes later, when services would have ended, it would have killed scores of worshipers leaving the synagogue. The act was claimed by the European National Fasces (FNE), the same group that had machine-gunned five Jewish buildings in Paris a week earlier.These latest of neofascist massacres have awakened Europeans to what many of them had managed not to see: the maturation over the last five years of what analysts now call Eurofascism\u2014loosely associated but politically aligned neo-Nazi groups, many of them dedicated to terrorism, all of them intent on saving Europe from the twin evils of capitalism and Marxism. While their membership is relatively small, they are well funded and some have access to training camps in Lebanon. In an interview given eight days before the Munich explosion, the PLO leader Abu Ayad revealed that in late 1979 two members of Hoffmann\u2019s group were captured in Lebanon and confessed to him that they and some thirty other European fascists were training at the Falangist camp at Aquru, northeast of Beirut.

New York Police Chief Ray Kelly said Dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off their remaining explosives.He said the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. When they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said the incident shows that New York, which was hit by terrorist attacks in 2001 that killed nearly 3,000 people, remains an inviting target.\"The fact is New York City remains a prime target for those who hate America and want to kill Americans,\" said Bloomberg.U.S. officials are continuing to examine whether the Boston Marathon attack could have been prevented, as warning signs emerged that Tamerlan was turning toward extremism.Senator Lindsey Graham said he believes Boston is becoming \"a case study in system failure\" by U.S. intelligence agencies.\u201cWe need to understand that Bin Laden may be dead, but the war against radical Islam is very much alive. Radical Islam is on the march and we need to up our game,\u201d said Graham.Authorities say Tamerlan Tsarnaev was placed on a U.S. counter-terrorism list in late 2011.The officials say the CIA asked that his name be placed on the list after the agency was contacted by the Russian government with its concerns that he had become a radical Islamist.Moscow also issued a similar warning on him to the FBI earlier in 2011. Officials say the agency launched an investigation, but eventually concluded he posed no threat.U.S. lawmakers have raised concerns about information sharing between U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon attack. Authorities will brief the full U.S. Senate on the investigation into the bombing.Several months after he first came to the attention of U.S. federal agents, Tamerlan Tsarnaev left the U.S. in January 2012 for a six-month visit to Russia. U.S. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to try to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have for decades been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia.", "events": [{"event_id": "10_VOA_EN_NW_2013.04.26.1649293-E1",

The explosion killed three people, including an 8-year-old boy, and injured another 264, with 17 people losing limbs and many others maimed from flying shrapnel.But during the trial, defense attorney Judy Clarke argued that Tsarnaev, then 19, fell under the influence of his radicalized older brother, Tamerlan, 26.Clarke, who has successfully kept other notorious U.S. murder convicts off death row, told the jury in her closing argument, \"If not for Tamerlan, it [the bombing] would not have happened.\"Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed days after the April 15, 2013, blasts, when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt. The brothers also shot to death a university patrol officer while attempting to flee authorities.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who lived in the United States for a decade before the bombings, was later found hiding in a boat parked in the backyard of a suburban Boston home.Prosecutors said he scrawled a motive for the attack on the inside wall of the boat, writing that the brothers were trying to avenge American attacks on Muslims in the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Defense caseLegal analysts said they don't expect the defense case to contain any new revelations about Tsarnaev.\"The crime is so horrific that they don't have much else really to point to, other than his age and the influence of his older brother,\" said Dan Collins, a former federal prosecutor who handled the case against a suspect in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, India.\"At this point, it's going to be the life experiences and the perspectives of the jurors in deciding whether or not they believe that these points are strong enough that his life should be spared,\" Collins said.Meg Penrose, a death penalty expert and professor at Texas A&M University School of Law, said it will be difficult for the jury to overcome the image of Tsarnaev planting a bomb just behind a group of children, including 8-year-old Martin Richard, who was killed.\"In a crime of this magnitude, what American citizen wouldn't ask, 'What would drive a person to do this?' And, as a juror, the question becomes, what answer would satisfy you?\" she said.Massachusetts has not executed anyone since 1947.The city's mayor, Marty Walsh, said he was glad to see the trial moving toward a conclusion.\"I am thankful that this phase of the trial has come to an end and am hopeful for a swift sentencing process,\" Walsh said. \"I hope [Wednesday\u2019s] verdict provides a small amount of closure for the survivors, families, and all impacted by the violent and tragic events.\"Tsarnaev relativeMeanwhile, in Russia, a relative of the brothers said she remains \"completely convinced that they were not guilty of this.\"\"These boys didn't need this,\" Rosa Tsarnaeva, a 66-year-old cousin of Tsarnaev's father, told The Associated Press. \"They never saw war, they were little when they arrived in the U.S. and grew up there.\"No one in the Tsarnaev family, none of the relatives, ever took part in the military campaigns in Chechnya\" in which separatists, some of them radical Islamists, fought two wars against Russian troops, she said.The brothers' father, who also lives in Russia, has not answered repeated phone calls or responded to text messages seeking his comment.Some material for this report came from AP and Reuters.Watch a related video report by VOA's Zlatica Hoke:Video sizewidthxheightpixelsBoston Jury to Mull Life or Death for TsarnaevShare this

organization attempted to destroy a police station by driving a car with a bomb into the wall of the building.Twenty-seven employees in the police station and two bystanders on the street were injured, although the only person killed was the attacker.== Cause ==In the last days of the Bosnian War, the Croatian Defense Council (HVO), a Bosnian Croat military force, captured Talaat Fouad Qasim when he attempted to enter Bosnia and Herzegovina.Qasim, an important member of al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, was soon transferred to Egypt with the active help of Croatia.Because of that and because Croatia had de facto controlled the Croatian Defence Council, the military organization which had captured Talaat Fouad Qasim, a decision was made to commit a terrorist attack in Croatia.== The attack ==At 11:21\u00a0a.m. Central European Time, a Fiat 131 Mirafiori entered the parking lot of the Primorje-Gorski Kotar County police headquarters.Due to the 90-degree turn needed to enter the lot, the vehicle moved slowly.Near the entrance, the driver did not park in the parking spaces for civilians, but instead started to accelerate towards the wall at the end of the parking lot.Due to the low security measures, this incident was not noticed before the attack itself took place.After 15\u201320 meters, passing 8-10 available parking spaces in the small lot, the Fiat crashed into the stairs leading to the police station and exploded.The time of explosion was recorded as 11:22\u00a0a.m. local time (10:22\u00a0UTC).Subsequently, a police investigation found out the car was loaded with  of highly-explosive TNT.The police also found a part of a Canadian passport inside the remains of the attacker's car.The next day, representatives of the al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya terrorist organization from Egypt claimed responsibility for the attack, requesting extradition of Qasim.Due to an error made by the attackers, the bombing did not cause fatalities, aside from the suicide bomber himself.The police headquarters is located on a higher ground than the parking lot itself, requiring the stairs in the first place.The other apparent miscalculation involved the size of the parking lot, where the Fiat 131 had neither the space and velocity, nor the horsepower, to climb the stairs and destroy the police station wall.As a result, the police station failed to collapse and only 29 injuries were recorded (including two unaware bystanders).The bomb also carved a large crater in the ground, battering nearby buildings and destroying vehicles.== Aftermath ==With the help of the CIA, officials examined the video footage of the attack.American and Croatian investigative sources came to the conclusion that Hassan al-Sharif Mahmud Saad had organized this attack.Saad had come to live in Bosnia only that year; previously, he had been living in Italy.Soon after the attack, Bosnian officials discovered that Saad was planning a new terrorist attack, against NATO forces, which was to happen in December 1995.A few days after that attack failed, he was killed in central Bosnia in a firefight with Croatian Defense Council forces.== See also ==*1993 Hidroelektra Workers Massacre== References

A source told news agency Reuters that police arrested him in Lyon after tailing him in the street. It reportedly decided not to arrest him in his apartment in case there were explosives in the building.The second suspect, according to local press, is a minor who attends a school in the city.Two other people, a man and a woman, have also been arrested.

But the committee issued a statement saying no evidence has been uncovered linking the group to the bombing that killed 14 people and left dozens more injured.Russian investigators have identified 22-year-old Kyrgyz-born Akbarzhon Dzhalilov as the suicide bomber who carried out the attack.A house in Osh, Kyrgyzstan, belonging to the parents of a man believed to be behind Monday's blast on a subway in St. Petersburg, Russia, April 4, 2017.World leaders from China to Europe to Brazil expressed their condolences over the tragedy. U.S. President Donald Trump phoned Russian President Vladimir Putin and offered full support in responding to the attack.Politicizing the bombingRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the global outpouring Russia received reflected a common understanding of the need to join efforts to fight terrorism instead of trying, according to him, to \u201cuse extremists to reach narrow geopolitical goals.\u201d\"With regard to the argument made by some media that the attack is revenge against Russia for our policy in Syria... [this is] cynical, cowardly,\" said Lavrov, who went on to point a finger at the previous U.S. administration. \"Sadly, this is not just a media fabrication: certain figures, including representatives of Obama administration\u2019s Pentagon, have shared similar thoughts with the world community.\u201dCity on edgeThe attack has left St. Petersburg residents on edge.St. Petersburg emergency services responded Tuesday morning to a bomb threat at a subway station near Monday\u2019s deadly blast on a train as it was passing between two stations. After receiving an anonymous call, police went to clear pedestrians from the area.Blast victims lie near a subway train hit by a explosion at the Tekhnologichesky Institut subway station in St.Petersburg, Russia, April 3, 2017.Reporters on the scene said fire trucks and ambulances quickly arrived. Authorities briefly closed subway stations. They searched for an unattended item before re-opening the stations. Russian media reports said the law department at St. Petersburg University was also evacuated because of a suspicious package.\u201cI think the atmosphere in the city is nervous,\u201d said one resident who only gave her first name \u2014 Anastasia. \u201cPeople walk and they do not understand what is happening. The public transport is too busy and is not coping. It is scary for us.\u201dRussia is holding three days of mourning for those killed. President Putin overnight laid flowers near the bombing cite in St. Petersburg in tribute. Putin was in the city when the bombing occurred, the timing of which Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov called \u201cfood for thought.\u201dA man lays flowers in memory of victims killed by a bomb blast in a subway train in St. Petersburg, at the memorial stone with the word Leningrad (St. Petersburg) at the Tomb of Unknown Soldier, in front of the Kremlin wall in Moscow, April 4, 2017.Ordinary Russians paid respects as well, laying flowers and messages at a makeshift memorial outside the subway stations in St. Petersburg and at the Leningrad Hero City memorial in front of the Kremlin wall in Moscow.Meanwhile, authorities are investigating what may have motivated the bombing, the first ever in Russia\u2019s second largest city.The most recent subway attack was in Moscow in 2010, when female suicide bombers connected to an Islamist insurgency in Chechnya were blamed for killing at least 33 people.

"Scotland Yard are searching for a group of about five people, including a \"baby faced\" teenage youth, in the wake of two bomb explosions at King's Cross and Euston stations in London yesterday.Thirteen people were injured, three seriously, in the lunchtime explosions. The attacks are the latest in the Provisional IRA's three week old bombing campaign in England carried out by small active service units. At King's Cross a 15 to 17-year-old youth ran on to Platform 8 and threw a brown paper parcel into the entrance of the old booking hall at 12.24 p.m.The youth described by one of the five injured in the blast as baby faced and \"too young to shave\" sprinted out of the station seconds before the 3lb. bomb exploded. A coded call gave police a three-minute warning of a second bomb at Euston which exploded at 1.16 p.m. in the Railbar injuring eight people.Scotland Yard said that the call, telephoned to the Press Association news agency was in the name of the same group which has given warnings about previous bombs in London. The caller, a man with an Irish accent, is believed to be responsible for all the warnings.Commander Robert Huntley, who is heading the investigation said the name of the group used in the calls enabled Scotland Yard to distinguish the real warnings from the hundreds of hoax calls. He would not disclose the code name but denied that the code name \"Persuaders\" - given to Birmingham police before the blast on Sunday night - had been used in London.The Commander attacked the hoax callers who were responsible yesterday for the closure of most main line stations in London while bomb searches were made.Charing Cross Station was evacuated after an anonymous bomb warning to the Sloane telephone exchange at 4.55p.m. After a search, passengers were allowed back at 5.30.Euston was also cleared after receiving a rush-hour threat. Other searches were made after calls to Paddington, Waterloo and London Bridge.Mr Huntley said yesterday's explosions, which followed the weekend attack on Victoria Station, appeared to be similar to the previous bombings and that the devices were \"typical of IRA manufacture.\" A piece of battery and part of a clock spring were found amid the debris at Euston, suggesting the charge had been timed and primed in exactly the same manner as other bombs.The police believe that the IRA are using at least two small squads of bombers operating in London and the Midlands who are almost constantly on the move living in cheap hotels and boarding houses.Asked about previous claims from Commander Ernest Bond that the bombers were close to arrest, Mr Huntley said he did not think the statement had been over-optimistic. Certain evidence had been compiled on those thought to be responsible. He indicated that the gang members were interchangeable and might not even live in this country.Commander Huntley said the bombers' tactics were now clear. The three-minute warning at Euston indicated that the aim of the bomb was \"to cause injury and destruction\" in a crowded station. He appealed for the public not to leave parcels, luggage, and containers unattended in public places but to keep property with them at all times.All those seriously injured yesterday were at Kings Cross - a Chinese couple from Hull and a London man. Mr Anthony Barber, the Chancellor, was sitting in a train which had just arrived when the bomb exploded. He joined the crowd helping the injured and asked if there was anything he could do.Although Scotland Yard are privately convinced that the recent wave of bombings has been the work of the Provisional IRA, police have failed to discover signs of a widespread IRA organisation in England.It seems likely that the bombing teams are either recruited in England, from outside the ranks of republican organisations and sympathisers, or are briefed and armed in Ireland and sent over individually.A small and changing group of four to six people operating alone in the London area without recourse to or contact with known republicans living here has largely neutralised the intelligence gathered by the Special Branch on Irish militants.The fact that the Provisionals' leadership has not yet claimed responsibility from Dublin has little bearing on its involvement. The salient point is that the Provos have always been quick to disclaim responsibility for incidents in which they are not involved and no such disclaimer has been issued.While it might well be true that extremists in England have taken advantage of the confusion created by the bombings to plant their own explosive devices, informed sources in Dublin consider it certain that the present campaign was both planned and approved by the IRA Army Council in Dublin.The explosions have almost certainly gone beyond what the Provisionals had originally intended but they see no reason to help Scotland Yard by claiming or disclaiming responsibility.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_3_news_4-E1", "trigger": "explosions", "manual": [{"question": "Who is searching for explosion culprits?

With all the nationalized \u201cbasic industries\u201d around here, they\u2019re a normal part of daily life. So I called around some of the ones I know to ask about today\u2019s vote. The stories I heard were\u2026 remarkably similar.Jos\u00e9 at FerromineraAt Ferrominera, the big mining company in Guayana, workers are being forced to vote for the Constituent Assembly. The deal is simple: vote or you\u2019re fired. At each department, the manager is responsible for making sure his people vote.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing subtle about it. The order comes face-to-face, in notices and even via text message. Employees must go to meetings where the order is to vote. Nobody cares who they vote for \u2014this is a single party election, man. Managers are required to make lists with the ID numbers of the employees voting, and send them to human resources by Monday.Jos\u00e9 \u2014not his real name\u2014 has worked at Ferrominera for 15 years. \u201cThey make everyone vote, especially those in higher positions.\u201dJos\u00e9 isn\u2019t voting, though. He\u2019s not wealthy and he doesn\u2019t have a plan B if they fire him, but he\u2019s taking the chance.\u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll do if I get fired,\u201d he says. \u201cMy daughter is in the hospital, I guess my wife and I will go with her. I don\u2019t know.\u201dIn his office, where barely ten people work, everyone has agreed to boycott the election. But, he adds, many others are compelled out of fear.Maria\u2019s mom at PDVSAMartha \u2014like all names, changed for this story\u2014 wouldn\u2019t talk to me. I had to approach her daughter Mar\u00eda instead. She talked to me in secret, without telling her mom. \u201cI know her, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll agree to an interview. She\u2019s too scared\u201d.She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at.Martha didn\u2019t go to the vote drill. Her boss harassed her and the other employees with constant texts, but there was only one voting center in Ciudad Guayana, and it was too far to consider it.For the real thing, the pressure is absurd. She must report to her boss the exact voting center she went to, and the time she went at. Martha will try a null vote. She\u2019s been in PDVSA for more than 20 years.Betania\u2019s dad at VenalumBetania\u2019s dad wouldn\u2019t talk to me (see a pattern?), but his daughter, an old friend, told me what he told the family. Her dad has been working for the big aluminum-maker way before chavismo was a thing: 25 years total.I just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.On Sunday, workers are being told to go to the plant first thing. They\u2019ll be put on buses to the voting centers. Managers are responsible for making sure the workers participate, and have lists saying where each worker votes. They must show up in the company\u2019s uniform too \u2014for the picture.Betania\u2019s dad is determined to vote. He has to protect his job; he\u2019s about to retire, he won\u2019t risk it. His family thinks he should stay home today. \u201cHere, they\u2019ll block the road at 5 am\u201d Betania tells me, \u201cso he might not be able to leave. We want him to stay, something might happen on the way there.\u201dShe catches her thoughts.\u201cI just wish they burn all of the voting machines, so no one can vote. I hate this fucking government with all my soul.\u201dJorge in the ArmyMilitary officers are forced to vote, just like any other state worker. As soldiers, they have to follow orders, or face trial by insubordination.I wish I could reveal more about my guy, but he wouldn\u2019t let me. He\u2019s a military officer and it\u2019s from el interior. He doesn\u2019t want to vote, and his plan is to show up, say hi and walk out. By showing himself, he thinks, he\u2019ll be off the hook.I reached out to people at two other state companies, but they refused to talk, even after I offered to change their names. The fear of dismissal makes getting the stories extremely hard, and look at the pattern I discovered: threats are explicit, demands are crystal clear and the workers?

Waziristan tribal area, zeroed in on a gathering of village men, some of whom were armed, and unleashed three missiles in quick succession. It turned out to be a meeting to settle a dispute over a chromite mine. Most of the 40 or so killed were civilians, according to accounts, though a dozen Taliban also died in the attack, including a local commander, Sherabat Khan. The Taliban nowadays often adjudicate quarrels in the tribal areas, a wild buffer zone that runs along Pakistan's border with Afghanistan.The attack illustrated two problems with the drone war in the tribal regions: the risk of civilian casualties, and Pakistan's ambiguous attitude towards America's use of drones. Pakistan's army chief, Ashfaq Kayani, called the strike a \u201ccomplete violation of human rights\u201d. For Pakistan, the difficulty went beyond civilian casualties. Khan was a lieutenant of a notable warlord, Gul Bahadur. But Pakistan considers Mr Bahadur to be a \u201cgood Taliban\u201d, ie, one who has agreed to fight only in Afghanistan, not on Pakistani soil. After the strike, he threatened to tear up the deal.Relations between the governments in Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, and Washington, DC, are deeply troubled by the issue of drones. Though it publicly denounces the drone strikes, Pakistan certainly does not want all of them stopped. Indeed, the co-operation of Pakistani intelligence is crucial to employing the drones. But the army wants the number of strikes reduced, concentrating on targets both countries can agree on. America has told Pakistan bluntly it must either flush the Taliban and other jihadists out of their safe havens in North Waziristan, or it will continue with what amounts to an assassination campaign there. Pakistan says it cannot launch a ground offensive in North Waziristan because its armed forces are already stretched.The drone attacks, a supposedly \u201csecret\u201d programme started by the CIA in 2004, have been ramped up over the past three years, with a record 118 strikes last year and 50 so far in 2011. The drones started under President Pervez Musharraf, the former military ruler. There were just nine strikes from 2004 to the end of 2007. According to Pakistani officials, it was supposed to be a highly selective programme for eliminating terrorist leaders in the tribal areas, under an understanding that gave the Americans the use of at least one remote Pakistani air base for the drones. The drones also take off from Afghanistan, but are operated thousands of miles away by a \u201cpilot\u201d at a desk in America, watching a video feed from the aircraft. A successful hit is known in the CIA as a \u201cbugsplat\u201d. It is all horribly like a video game.The New America Foundation, a Washington think-tank, found that up to 2,551 people have been killed in the strikes since 2004. Based on press reports, it estimates that 80% of them were militants, rising to a pretty astonishing 95% in 2010. In recent months, there has been a move away from blowing up compounds to targeting vehicles, where militants can more easily be hit without killing civilians. Even for compounds, smaller missiles are used to try to limit the damage to the separate male living quarters. Perceptions on the ground, however, are often different. The foundation's own poll in the tribal areas last year found only 16% believe the drones accurately target militants. But many locals privately support the strikes against extremists who have overrun their homeland.Accepting the figure for the success rate in killing militants nevertheless means that fully 500 or so Pakistani civilians have been killed since 2004. Unlike, say, in the war in Afghanistan, there is no investigation of civilian casualties, and no compensation paid. Transparency and accountability are absent, and some question the legal basis of the attacks. The programme is a charade because the CIA never admits to it and Pakistan pretends that it does not co-operate. A legal action launched this month, initially in Pakistan, with the backing of Reprieve, a campaigning group, seeks the arrest of a former CIA lawyer, John Rizzo, who boasted in a magazine interview this year that he used to approve a monthly list of some 30 individuals to be targeted by the drones.Whatever the outcome of that case, a debate will grind on about whether the strikes are harming al-Qaeda and related groups, or spurring on Afghanistan's powerful insurgency. According to the New America Foundation, out of the 2,600-odd deaths, 35 were recognised militant chiefs, or just 1.3% of the total. Among the successes was the fearsome leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, who was the country's number one public enemy. Still, the vast majority of targets have been low-level fighters. All the while, the number of suicide attacks in Afghanistan, many launched from Pakistan, has soared over the past year or more.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_0_news_9-E1", "trigger":

As the bombs went off in sequence, now in one part of the city, now in another, rumour took over, naked fear and anxiety. Warnings were given, perhaps deliberately erroneous, maybe not, maybe hoax calls, perhaps not but the effect was the same.Groups of office and shop workers ordered to evacuate threatened premises, gathered at street corners only to run in shrieking droves as a bomb went off nearer the place in which they had sought refuge.The smell of fear exceeded only by the whiff of powder, enveloping smoke, the jangle of ambulances and fire engines and screaming police cars, and office alarms crying heedlessly to the air, the smell of smoke and dust, sound of shattering glass, the cries of fear and horror, the stench of burning timber, burning rubber, burning metal, burning flesh.And most of all the horror of Oxford Street Bus Station where commuter deaths brought the savagery of the city to surrounding towns and villages as people waited for those who had gone to work or to shop to return.Nine did not and many others returned home broken and injured and not only physically. The final horror of the television news reels of body parts being shovelled into polythene bags by those whose insufficiently recognised task it was to clear up the carnage.If it has taken the Provisional IRA 30 years to face up to the enormity of what they did on that day and on many other days, and to apologise for the hurt caused, it has not come a day too soon. Or indeed too late either, in what we are now seeing the beginning of a real effort to promote the process of healing, to bind up the wounds and to enable the community to face the future together.Acceptance of responsibility is always a good starting point. Regrets for hurts done is the next stage. Forgiveness for wounds received perhaps the next, and acceptance that no side has a monoply of victimhood, or virtue or validity is perhaps the closure.The IRA statement starts as an apology for the hurts inflicted on innocent victims on a particular occasion. These will not be additionally reassured by being classified as non-competence, but it goes much further than that. Bloody Friday is as good a symbol as any of the universality of suffering at the futility of violence.There are those who will carp at the exclusion of those implicitly typified as combatants - presumably policemen, soldiers and prison officers and others unfortunate enough to be designated as legitimate targets. Many of these too, even allowing the doubtful premise of legitimacy were shot down in ambush, in cold blood in the domestic situation, but so, republicans will argue were many of their victims too.The statement does go on to recognise the hurt of all victims, combatant and non-combatant, and it would be ungenerous not to recognise the impulse for reconciliation which lies behind these words - or the effort that has been required to bring it about. Thirty years ago even innocent victims were dismissed as the unfortunate casualties of war, in the wrong place at the wrong time. Things have moved a long way when all can be seen as victims, when the hurts of all can be recognised.When the IRA first announce a ceasefire, they were castigated for not including some phrase of regret, some words of apology. This was further highlighted when some weeks later Gusty Spence announced the loyalist ceasefire in terms which included an apology for hurts inflicted which was quite moving at the time. Subsequent loyalist activity has not eradicated the value of that statement in that context. Neither should current disturbances or uncertainties be used to denigrate the IRA statement.Some elements of unionism will remain implacable no matter what republicans say or do. Others will demand additional deeds rather than words. Others still will argue a lack of moral equivalency, that illegality can never be legitimised or terrorism condoned. The important thing now is how that statement and the sentiments behind it, which should be recognised as genuine and not merely a rhetorical or political ploy are accepted by those who have been on the receiving end by the relatives of victims and survivors, many of whom have been horribly mutilated.In general, such people have proved to be much more willing to forgive than those who have suffered by proxy. Those who experienced Bloody Friday in Belfast may welcome the statement more than those who viewed it from afar. In any case, to recall the events shows how far society has moved on towards peace since then.For the long suffering populace of Northern Ireland, like the mothers in O'Casey's play \"on either side of a scales of sorrow, weighed down by the bodies of our suffering sons\", this is a significant and a very welcome statement.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_9-E1", "trigger": "went off", "manual": [{"question": "What went off?", "answer": "bombs"}, {"question": "Where did the bombs go off?", "answer": "Belfast"}, {"question": "How did they go off?", "answer": "in sequence"}], "gpt": [{"question": "What happened in Belfast on Bloody Friday?", "answer": "bombs went off"}, {"question": "Where did the bombs go off?", "answer": "in sequence, now in one part of the city, now in another"}, {"question": "When did Bloody Friday happen?", "answer": "30 years ago"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_9-T7", "role": "Instrument", "text": "bombs"}]}]}, "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981": {"text": "2 New Suspects Sought in Bangkok BombingBANGKOK \u2014\u00a0Thai authorities investigating this month\u2019s deadly Bangkok bomb attack on Monday announced finding more bomb-making materials in a raid on an apartment in the capital and arrest warrants for two new suspects \u2013 a 26-year-old Thai woman and a foreign man.A photograph of the woman, identified as Wanna Suansan, in a hijab and a sketch of the unnamed male suspect were shown on a special broadcast on all Thai television channels at noon.The disclosure came after police raided an apartment building Sunday, initially telling reporters nothing suspicious had been found.But on the Monday broadcast, national police Lt. General Prawut Thavornsiri said fertilizer, explosives detonators and digital watches were seized during Sunday's search of multiple units in an apartment complex in the Min Buri district of Bangkok.Police claim rewardPolice on Monday also announced that a 3 million baht (about $83,000) reward offered to the public for information leading to the arrest of the bombing suspects would instead be paid to the police, after a 28-year-old foreign man was apprehended in a Saturday raid.The suspect faces charges of possessing explosives.\u201cThis was the work of the Thai officials, there were no tip-offs,\u201d the national police chief, General Somyot Pumpanmuang, told reporters as he displayed bundles of the reward cash he said was from his personal funds and a donation from an anonymous businessman friend of his.Officials said they found explosives, chemicals, ball bearings and other elements to make pipe bombs in a unit on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok where they apprehended the foreigner.FILE - Thai police stand on the balcony outside of an apartment building in Nong Jok on the outskirts of Bangkok, Aug. 29, 2015. Thai police say they arrested a suspect in the blast at the Erawan Shrine in this apartment building.The components were said to be similar to those used in devices that detonated at the Erawan Shrine on August 17 and in the Chao Phraya River, adjacent to the Sathorn Pier, the following day.The blast at the Hindu shrine, popular with Chinese and other Asian tourists, killed 20 people and wounded more than 100 others \u2013 the worst single mass casualty attack in Thailand.The subsequent explosion at the pier caused no injuries. Uighur deportationIt is unclear whether the shrine bombing has any connection to Thailand\u2019s deportation in July of more than 100 ethnic Uighurs to China, army commander-in-chief General Udomdej Sitabutr said Monday.Thai authorities have been hesitant to link the attack to international terrorism.Instead, authorities have insisted since Saturday that it is likely connected to a human smuggling organized crime ring or a gang bent on revenge for crackdowns by police.Analysts have given those explanations little credence and human rights groups have expressed concern about how the lack of legitimate political, security and judicial authority in a country under military government could undermine public trust in the investigation\u2019s outcome.The head of the Thai military junta, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, has cautioned against concluding that the shrine bombing was linked to international terrorism or mentioning any possible connection to Turkey.Thai police Lieutenant General Prawut Thavornsiri speaks to the media at the Royal Thai Police headquarters in Bangkok, Thailand, Aug. 30, 2015.In recent days speculation had increased about the bombing\u2019s possible link to China's ethnic Uighur minority or their co-religious sympathizers in Turkey.Thailand's deportation of the Uighurs led to an attack on the Thai consulate in Istanbul where windows were smashed.The Turkish Embassy in Bangkok denied that the arrested suspect is a citizen of Turkey, Lt. General Prawut told reporters on Sunday.Authorities also made conflicting statements Saturday and Sunday on whether they believed the man was the suspect caught on closed circuit television images leaving a package at the popular Hindu shrine in central Bangkok just prior to the explosion.CriticizedThe junta also came under criticism after airing a photograph of a suicide vest while its officials discussed evidence found on Saturday they said was related to the bombings.It was quickly pointed out that the picture of the vest had come from a 2013 blog online of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration.That disclosure prompted Thai authorities to acknowledge the photograph had no connection to their case and they demanded the media and public refrain from further disseminating the picture.", "events": [{"event_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-E1", "trigger": "attack", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "What was the target of the attack?", "answer": "Erawan Shrine"}, {"question": "When did the attack occur?", "answer": "August 17"}, {"question": "How many people were killed in the attack?", "answer": "20 people"}, {"question": "Who was injured in the attack?", "answer": "more than 100 others"}, {"question": "Where did the subsequent explosion occur?", "answer": "at the pier/Chao Phraya River"}, {"question": "Was anyone injured in the subsequent explosion?", "answer": "No injuries were reported."}, {"question": "What is the worst single mass casualty event in Thailand?", "answer": "the attack on Erawan Shrine"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-T75", "role": "ExplosiveDevice", "text": "bomb"}, {"entity_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-T65", "role": "Place", "text": "Bangkok"}]}, {"event_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-E2", "trigger": "arrest", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "Who was arrested?", "answer": "a 28-year-old foreign man"}, {"question": "What was the reward for?", "answer": "information leading to the arrest of the bombing suspects"}, {"question": "Who offered the reward?", "answer": "the police"}, {"question": "When was the suspect apprehended?", "answer": "in a Saturday raid"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-T135", "role": "Jailer", "text": "suspects"}, {"entity_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-T131", "role": "Jailer", "text": "woman"}, {"entity_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-T118", "role": "Jailer", "text": "man"}]}, {"event_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-E3", "trigger": "arrest", "manual": [], "gpt": [], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-T14", "role": "Jailer", "text": "suspects"}]}, {"event_id": "39_VOA_EN_NW_2015.08.31.2938981-E4", "trigger": "charges", "manual": [{"question": "Who is facing charges?", "answer": "the suspect"}, {"question": "What charges is the suspect facing?", "answer": "possessing explosives\n"}, {"question": "Who is the man facing charges?

ISIS has started using small drones packed with explosives as weapons.The first attack was a failure, but if the report is accurate, then it signals a dangerous new terror threat.The report showed pictures of the remains of a homemade attack drone.It was apparently shot down, along with a second drone that exploded, by Kurdish YPF (\"People's Defence Units\") fighters in Syria.The caption says that both drones carried explosives, and that no YPF fighters were injured in the incident.Unlike many jihadi groups, ISIS has proven itself tech-savvy\u2014the organization is known for its use of social media, for instance.This latest development is not surprising, as it follows a long history of drone usage.In late 2014, during the battle for Kobane, ISIS started using footage taken from dronesin their propaganda videos.Around the same time, ISIS started using quadrotors for battlefield reconnaissance.A number of them, mainly DJI quadrotors, were reportedly shot down or captured by Kurdish fighters, according to a news report from December 2014.These drones were apparently used as artillery spotters, finding targets and correcting the fall or fire for mortar crews.By early this year, ISIS drones had become important enough to be targeted by U.S. airstrikes.A CENTCOM report in March mentions that \"Near Fallujah, an airstrike destroyed an ISIL remotely piloted aircraft and an ISIL vehicle.\"\"We observed it flying for approximately 20 minutes.We observed it land.We observed the enemy place it in the trunk of a car and we struck the car,\" according to Pentagon spokesman Colonel Steve Warren.Warren described the drone as \"a model airplane\" and \"commercially available, remotely piloted aircraft, really something anyone can get.\"Another ISIS drone (\"remotely piloted vehicle\") was destroyed in an airstrike in June, and a third in August.Friends of YPG YPJIn fact, ISIS tactical drones seem to be appearing all over this year.In September the Levant Front (or Jabhat al-Shamiyya) released pictures of a camera-carrying Talon drone they brought down, which they say was flown by ISIS.The X-UAV Talon is available in kit form for about $100; it is made of plywood with a six-foot wingspan and has a large fuselage compartment for cameras or other payloads.In October, Iraqi police shot down a fixed-wing ISIS drone near Ramadi.Again it was of the small, hand-launched variety, though a different model, and the Iraqis say it was photographing military units.Even al-Qaeda has released pictures and video of what is claims was a downed ISIS drone.This flurry of drone activity is a reflection of just how easy it has become to acquire and fly drones.Just as home computers were once confined to dedicated hobbyists but found a wider market, drones have broken into the mainstream with models that require no piloting or technical skills to fly.This gives ISIS access to aerial reconnaissance that would otherwise be impossible in the face of the air superiority of Syrian, Russian, and Western forces.The pictures of the ISIS attack drone were posted by a user called \"Catelyn Carrigan\" on the Facebook page of the group \"Friends of the YPG YPJ\" with the headline \"YPG Shoots Down 2 ISIS Drones.\"The location of the new pictures is given as \"Southern Koban\u00ea, Qracoezag province near the bridge.\"We received no response to queries for more information on the pictures.This would not be the first terrorist drone strike.Hamas and Hezbollah, for example, both have used fixed-wing kamikaze drones with explosive warheads, but those were larger, modified versions of military Mirsad and Ababbil drones supplied by Iran.The ISIS drones do not rely on imported military technology, but can be assembled in a garage, for cheap.Some eagled-eyed redditors believe the drone in question today is the Skwalker X7 or X8, which costs $179 for the kit.As we've recently noted, small drones make effective battlefield weapons.The Switchblade by American company AeroVironment and the Israeli Hero-30 have both proven lethal, giving a foot soldier the power to launch his own airstrike to locate and hit a target from several miles away from behind cover.These military drones boast jam-proof communications, sophisticated terminal guidance, and advanced warheads.But even a crude, home-made version might be deadly in a terrorist attack against a soft target.During the recent terror attacks in Paris, the attackers were unable to gain access to the Stade de France, which was packed with fans for a soccer game.But drones cannot be stopped by walls or fences.While they can only carry a small amount of explosive compared to a suicide bomber, they can be deployed in significant numbers, and they can be directed with great accuracy against vulnerable targets.Of course, security forces are already looking at how to mitigate the threat from small drones, and various defensive measures are already in place, from nets to electronic detectors and jammers.Commercial drones can be stopped easily enough by jamming their control frequencies, or even hacking them to take over the drone, but purpose-built attack drones will be much harder to combat.Small drones can be built for a few thousand dollars in any home workshop.3D printed drones are no longer a novelty, and how-to guides can be shared easily over the internet.It is far too late to stop this technology from proliferating.ISIS first drone attack may have failed, but it is not likely to be the last.It may be time to get serious about defending against small drones.David Hambling's new bookSwarm Troopers: How small drones will conquer the worldis out this month.", "events": [{"event_id": "JC002YBVW-E2", "trigger": "Packing", "manual":

He died as he endeavoured to warn others of the presence of an unexploded car bomb. An innocent victim of a terrorist outrage in a purely residential area of the City.The Stephen Parker Memorial Trust was born out of this tragic situation. Knowing how much Stephen appreciated his place in the CBYO, his parents decided that his memorial had to be capable of contributing in the long term towards \"the life and welfare of his beloved orchestra.\" A substantial sum of money donated at the time of Stephen's death was invested and has been further added to over the years. Each year 75% of the annual income of this investment is awarded as a prize to \"the member or members of the City of Belfast Youth Orchestra who make the best all round progress during the year.\" Students are then free to use this award to further their musical study through assisting with lessons or masterclasses or contributing towards the purchase of equipment.The residual amount is reinvested to maintain the value of the prize.Stephen was a trier and his parents felt it appropriate that \"evidence of having tried very hard\" ought to be the major factor in deciding eligibility for his memorial prize.Each year the trustees of the memorial meet to decide upon a winner based on evidence provided by the Orchestra staff. The winner is announced and the recipient presented with the award during the Orchestra's Summer Concert.The Stephen Parker Memorial Trust is administered by the Belfast Education and Library Board.Anyone wishing to make a donation to the trust can do so care of :Mrs Rowena EamesHead of Music ServicesCity of Belfast School of Music99 Donegall PassBelfastBT7 1DRThis year's winner of the Stephen Parker AwardMalachy Frame with conductor of CBYO, Paul McBriePrevious Winners2011 Malachy Frame2010 Susanna Gawn2009 Emma King2008 David Douglas2007 Christopher Rooney2006 Charles Reilly2005 Sarah Brown2004 Michael Trainor2003 David McCann2002 Ciaran McCabe2001 Scott Foster2000 Jonathan Corry / Michael McHale1999 Jonathan Coffey1998 Peter Black1997 Roger McCann1996 Kate Openshaw1995 Natalie Thompson1994 Anne Harper1993 S Nesbitt1992 Robin Clinton1991 M C Lowry1990 A Carney1989 C Taylor1988 J Fleming1987 Ruth Montgomery1986 Nigel Ireland1985 Cheryl Agnew1984 Marianne Ho / Ruth Kilpatrick1983 Janet McMaster / Margaret Flanagan1982 David McMaster1981 Rosin McCrisken1980 Kathryn Clements / Jennifer McCreery1979 Eleanor Wilkinson1978 Pauline Fitzpartick1977 Paul McCrisken1976 Jeremy Adair1975 Hazel Mulligan / Dominic McHugh1974 Noleen Bell / John Anderson1973 Charles Wood", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_10-E1", "trigger": "died", "manual": [{"question": "Who died?", "answer": "Stephen"}, {"question": "How did he die?", "answer": "he endeavoured to warn others of the presence of an unexploded car bomb"}], "gpt": [{"question": "Who died?", "answer": "Stephen Parker"}, {"question": "When did Stephen Parker die?", "answer": "July 21st, 1972"}, {"question": "How did Stephen Parker die?", "answer": "He endeavoured to warn others of the presence of an unexploded car bomb."}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_1_news_10-T13", "role": "Victim", "text": "He"}]}]}, "scenario_en_kairos_9": {"text": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) \u2014 A teenager who authorities accused of trying to blow up a homemade backpack bomb at a southern Utah high school after watching Islamic State propaganda been sentenced to four years of probation.The Spectrum newspaper in St. George reports that that the 17-year-old boy was sentenced in adult court Thursday.The boy's attorney, Edward Flint, said his client snapped after being bullied at school.Judge G.

attacks: \u201cWe have limited ability to control what people do with our products\u201dThe world\u2019s largest drone manufacturer, DJI, has issued a statement after two of their drones armed with explosives were used in an apparent assassination attempt against Venezuelan president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last week.The drones in question appeared to be Matrice 600s; commercial-level UAVs intended for aerial photography and costing around $5000 each.The Venezuelan government claims that each Matrice was packed with a kilo of C4 and were intended to kill Maduro and other important Venezuelan political figures.https://www.wetalkuav.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/1024x576_MP4_4439375926361635711.mp4A video of the drone exploding from media at the eventDJI spoke with Dezeen magazine and told them that \"DJI makes products purely for peaceful purposes.\"\"While we build some prudent safety and security features into our products, we have limited ability to control what people do with them.\"They stated that the overwhelming majority of DJI drone operators use their drones peacefully, and they \"deplore any use of our products to bring harm to anyone.\"\"As with any technology, if people decide to misuse our products in any way, they have to be responsible for their actions,\" they said.Two DJI Matrice 600\u2019s were seemingly used in an attack against President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Venezuela last week.Who was responsible for the drone attacks and why did they fail?It is, as yet, unclear who exactly was reponsible for the attacks.One group calling themselves \u2018Soldiers in T-shirts\u2018 claimed responsibility on Twitter.Maduro alleged Venezuela\u2019s ultra-right in alliance with Colombia\u2019s ultra-right and their outgoing president, Juan Manuel Santos were behind the assassination attempt.The Venezuelan government has used the attacks as justification for a further crackdown on political opponents and have arrested at least 6 people.Neither drone ultimately made it to their intended targets.According to Venezuela\u2019s Attorney General, this was because they were deflected from reaching their intended course through protective radio emissions eminating from Venzuelan intelligence personnel (similar to drone killing devices we\u2019ve written about previously).Video footage from multiple angles since the attack suggest that one drone exploded above the soldiers on parade (causing 7 injuries) while the other crashed into the window of an apartment, causing the apartment to catch fire (this was initially reported in some outlets as the result of gas explosion).The website Bellingcat has an excellent rundown of all evidence related to the drone attack including video footage and photos from multiple angles, if you\u2019re interested.A soldier injured by the exploding drone at the Venezualan National Guard celebration parade in CaracasDespite some claims in media, it seems unlikely the government would stage an attack against itself.As the Economist noted, \"Dictators depend on projecting an image of omnipotence\u2026 in the television footage, Mr Maduro looked befuddled; the massed ranks of the National Guard broke discipline and ran off in panic.\"In essence, the attacks made Maduro look weak, not strong.False flag operations have happened throughout history but thus far, this does not appear to be one of them.Story continues on page 2", "events": [{"event_id": "K0C041O3D-E1", "trigger": "attacks", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "What is the trigger word?", "answer": "attacks"}, {"question":

St.George, Utah, March 5, 2018 | Photos sent to St.George NewsST.GEORGE, Utah \u2014 A teen who brought explosives to Pine View High School has been sentenced to jail time.Martin Farnsworth, 17, was ordered to serve 415 days in detention with credit for time served (which he has already served).He also was given 48 months probation, 250 hours of community service, and court-ordered treatment and any recommended medication by 5th District Court Judge Michael Westfall.He was also ordered to have no access to the internet or explosive materials or bomb-making components.He pleaded guilty in March to a charge of intent to commit injury with an incendiary device, a first-degree felony.He was originally charged with attempted murder and possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as well as misdemeanor graffiti charges.The case was originally filed in juvenile court, but Farnsworth was later transferred to the adult court system.Farnsworth was arrested last year after police said he brought a backpack loaded with a bomb to Pine View High.Prosecutors said he lit a fuse, but the bomb did not detonate.Police also accused him of researching information about the terror group ISIS online.He was also accused of replacing an American flag at a school in Hurricane with a pro-ISIS flag.\"If I didn\u2019t get caught from this, if people got hurt and I could get away from it?I would have laid low for a little while, kind of see what people\u2019s reactions were, whether there were comments about it, etc.Then later on try to hang an ISIS flag somewhere like on a school or maybe on the freeway, make it look like ISIS is here.Then maybe after that try to contact ISIS, but I don\u2019t really know how to do that.I need to do more research on that,\" he told police, according to a court filing FOX 13 reported on last year.A psychologist testified on his behalf that Farnsworth was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.Copyright 2020 Scripps Media, Inc.All rights reserved.This

Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Invalid EmailOn the night of the bomb attacks M J Niels McGuinness was working as a photographer for the Press Association. With local journalists on strike, pictures and accounts from the night can often seem somewhat sparce. Here's his account of that terrible evening, as told to Carl Chinn.November 21, 1974 was a night I shall never forget. My memories of that night have not changed, they have remained with me.Working as a press photographer for the National news agency, The Press Association I was requested earlier in the day to cover the funeral arrangements of a Provisional IRA terrorist, James McDade at Birmingham Airport. A week earlier he had blown himself up when he tried to plant a bomb at the Coventry Telephone Exchange in Little Park Street.There had been a feeling of high tension after the Coventry incident. Indeed, there had been a spate of terrorist activities in the Midlands leading up to the Birmingham pub bombings.At the airport, cargo staff refused to load McDade's coffin on a Belfast bound flight where he was to be buried. Hundreds of police surrounded the terminals searching everyone entering the building and the car parking areas.Eventually it was agreed on compassionate grounds to have his body flown to Dublin. My films of the activities at the airport were handed to a dispatch rider for processing at the Press Association office in Fleet Street.My first impression when I arrived in the Bull Ring was like the Blitz all over again, broken plate glass windows littered the surrounding streets, people were running all over the place, I must have got there within minutes of the explosions.I carried two Pentax cameras loaded with black and white film when I entered the Mulberry Bush. It was a scene of total carnage, bodies all over the place which were covered with debris and rafters from the ceiling and the floor above, the whole interior of the pub was ripped apart.As I tried to tread discreetly amongst the rubble and broken furniture I was unable to find anyone who might possibly be still alive. Firemen rushed in to remove the unfortunate victims away. One of them tapped me on the shoulder to say that another bomb had gone off in the crowded basement of the Tavern in the Town pub.It was there that I took a flash picture of Birmingham fireman Ralph Dawes with a young lad in shirtsleeves who were carrying bodies in red canvas sheets.I saw many people fleeing in all directions from the devastation caused by the bombs, which exploded within two minutes of each other. There was a young lady in a bloodstained dress sitting stunned on a kerbstone outside the Odeon Cinema.At the entrance of the cinema a number 90 Birmingham Corporation bus with a destination blind showing Pheasey Estate Great Barr who had just stopped to pick up passengers. The extreme force of the blast caused all the windows of the bus to be blown out injuring many people.There wasn't a shop window in New Street leading from the Rotunda to Corporation Street which wasn't affected. I recall vividly the numerous burglar alarms which were set off and the flashing blue emergency lights of the convoy of fire engines and ambulances.At one stage the ambulances were stuck in the congestion. The black cabs came to the rescue by ferrying some of the injured to the General Hospital in Steelhouse Lane.For two hours I continued to take pictures of the horrible unfolding events. Time was getting late and I needed to get my films back to the office. So I decided to make my way on foot to Digbeth Coach Station to hire a cab. Normally I would have processed my films at the Birmingham Post and Mail and wired the prints to Fleet Street. However the National Union of Journalists were on strike. Taxis were hard to hire, however, I managed to persuaded a driver to deliver my films direct to Fleet Street.Six pictures were released to all the National newspapers, the provincial press and television newsrooms in the U.K. during the early hours of the following morning. Under the severe circumstances the journalists called off their strike making it possible to bring out an emergency edition of the Birmingham Evening Mail.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_ied_bombings_5_news_9-E1", "trigger": "blown", "manual": [{"question": "Who blew themselves up?", "answer": "James McDade"}, {"question": "Where did he blow himself up?

Targets are considered to be enemy combatants. But if they were to be apprehended in the country where they plan to perpetrate their attack they would not be killed, they would be arrested and put on trial.Targeted killings are a both a domestic issue and an international one and they combine resources gathered from intelligence means and military power. They are one of the constitutive elements of the preventive use of force framework that emerged in the early 2000s.Killing by droneTargeted killings were introduced by Israel just after the start of the second intifada in 2000; the idea came from the Israeli internal security agency, Shin Bet. Israel is unapologetic about these assassinations and ample information about the killings is available.The issue has been brought to the Supreme Court, which has repelled the accusation of illegality of the operations. It has also defined a set of restrictive criteria in order to regulate their use.Back then, Israel was criticised severely by the US, but that was two weeks before 9/11. Once the US was hit, the Bush administration started its own global program of targeted killings in the context of what became the doctrinal setting of the so-called \u201cwar on terror\u201d.The global war on terror has often stirred criticism in France, both in civil society circles and in government. This should not come as a surprise since it is hard, if not impossible, to convince third parties that US law should authorise the violation of state sovereignty and that such unilateralism apply to the use of force.Today, the UK has a programme of its own and France is also on board. French President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has set a \u201ckill list\u201d of jihadists who, his advisors believe, are a threat to French citizens. France, we knew, killed a jihadist in October 2015, but we now have information that this is not an isolated case.What we see today is the versatility of democracies and their selfishness. When leaders believe national security is not at risk, a discourse inspired by human rights prevails. When leaders believe there are security problems, especially if the lives of their civilians are at risk on their own soil, rights are not a primary concern. When abiding by principles is costly, they are put aside.This is the old \u201cbalancing\u201d debate: the security versus rights dilemma. In theory it is a sophisticated one, the practice is less nuanced.Prime Minister Manuel Valls\u2019s response to journalists who asked him if those operations were legal was telling. With a mix of candour, foolishness and arrogance, he responded that they ought not to ask questions that \u201care making things too complicated\u201d.A global problemSo far, the US program of targeted elimination is the most problematic. It can be argued that Israel is in conflict with Palestine and therefore the use of force is permissible in certain areas of the Palestinian territories, as, in times of war and during conflicts, the killing of combatant by other combatants is legal and legitimate. This does not mean that Israeli targeted killings program is immune to criticism and that what has become a routine is justifiable.But the US program authorises the US to kill its targets in countries it is not at war with or in the absence of conflict, in some cases these are even allies, such as Pakistan where, for obvious reasons, they create great resentment.The area covered by the US program is huge and the number of operations very significant. Unlike in the case of Israel, no official data is available (especially concerning the number of civilians who die because of the attacks). The targets\u2019 selection is also problematic, especially in the case of \u201csignature strikes\u201d \u2013 those targets that are selected on a statistical basis.The decision to strike depends on the signals that individuals display and which make them look suspicious. A young male dressed in clothes that cover his face, and taking a stroll at night in a Pakistani area where rebels are known to live has good reasons to fear for his security.As the US will pursue if not expand its targeted killings policy, we need to be aware of the problems inherent to this practice. They are legally dubious. They create political tensions between those who use them and those states where they are operating.Finally, their efficacy has not been proven. Even, in the Israeli case, some, very convincingly, challenge that targeted killings are the cause of the decrease of suicide bombers.Who\u2019s next, what\u2019s next?Other liberal countries are jumping on the bandwagon, such as the US\u2019s gentle neighbour Canada. But the next step is even more intriguing.For now, we see a clear North-South divide: Western states are shooting while the Middle East, Africa and Muslim areas are taking the bullets. But this might change.What will happen when Russia, Turkey and China launch their own operations? This will mark the end of Western exceptionalism.In Israel and in the US, democracies are engaged in vivid legal debates on the legality of the operations they carry out.The outcome of this endeavour has been to try to define domestic laws that would allow the use of force at the international level, which is already contrary to the spirit of international law (if not its content). At the international level, we saw some attempts to address this issue at the UN, but, so far, the results of these efforts have been mitigated.What happens when non-democracies where human rights and international humanitarian laws, to say the least, are not a priority, use drones or other devices to perform targeted killings? It is probable that because they care less and have fewer resources and expertise than the US, their operations will be less precise?Is their power likely to be contained? It is unlikely that the US and Western states will be able to push in this direction. After all, they initiated the process. In this regard, the recent confrontation over Syria between US ambassador Samantha Power and the Russian representative Vitaly Churkin at the UN in December 2016 is very telling about the general situation we are in.Power repeatedly and emphatically asked the Russians if they felt no \u201cshame\u201d, because of the heavy bombings they carried out in order to rescue and resuscitate the Assad regime. In return, Churkin mocked Power by bluntly emphasising that she built \u201cher statement as if she was Mother Teresa\u201d. He told her to remember of her \u201cown country track record\u201d, instead of trying to display such unwarranted \u201cmoral supremacy\u201d.We have to envisage the future consequences of the expansion of targeted killings as a norm and be aware of the dangers of their spread. It will be more difficult for those who want to occupy the moral high ground or simply to limit the use of force to denounce the absurdity of this situation. Western elites in government and outside, by that time, will have already made too many concessions with the principles they want others to uphold.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-E1", "trigger": "killed", "manual": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "a jihadist"}], "gpt": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "a jihadist"}, {"question": "When was the killing?", "answer": "October 2015"}, {"question": "Who did the killing?", "answer": "France"}, {"question": "Why did France have a \"kill list\"?", "answer": "to eliminate jihadists who are a threat to French citizens"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-T16", "role": "Victim", "text": "members"}, {"entity_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-T17", "role": "Place", "text": "Yemen"}, {"entity_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-T13", "role": "Killer", "text": "US"}]}, {"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-E2", "trigger": "killed", "manual": [], "gpt": [], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-T67", "role": "Killer", "text": "France"}, {"entity_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_3-T69", "role": "Victim", "text": "jihadist"}]}]}, "road_ied_9": {"text": "10 civilians killed in roadside bomb blast in E.

said that he was \u201ccontaminating people\u2019s minds\u201d; and began calling him a hypocrite.People of the congregation, in turn, shouted back at the older suspect, \u201cLeave now!\u201d Due to the congregation\u2019s disapproval, he left the sermon.After the sermon and the congregational prayer ended, a few volunteer leaders of the mosque sat down with the older suspect and gave him a clear choice: either he stops interrupting sermons and remains silent or he would not be welcomed.While he continued to attend some of the congregational prayers after the January incident, he neither interrupted another sermon nor did he cause any other disturbances.The statement said that no member of the mosque\u2019s board or staff \u201cever interacted\u201d with either Dzhokhar or Tamerlan, who it said \u201cdisagreed with the moderate American-Islamic theology of the I.S.B.Cambridge mosque.\u201d\u201cOur mosque is one filled with attendees who are teachers, businessmen, doctors and lawyers, all of whom are committed to the public good,\u201d the statement said.\u201cWhile these suspects did express views counter to our mosque\u2019s philosophy, they never expressed any hint of violent sentiments or behavior.If they had, the F.B.I.would have immediately been called.\u201dOn Saturday, the mosque posted a long note on its front door, which was photographed and uploaded to Twitter by several people, including Steve Annear, a freelance journalist and contributor to Boston Magazine.Here is the note about the bombing suspects on the door of the Islamic Society of Boston.They were guest s there.//t.co/vdv1ZWxagi \u2014 Steve Annear (@steveannear) 21 Apr 13The note expressed shock and sadness at the bombing of the Boston Marathon and urged members of the congregation to contact the F.B.I.with any information they may have about the Tsarnaev brothers.The statement was also posted on the mosque\u2019s Web site.", "events": [{"event_id": "backpack_ied_2-E1", "trigger": "killed", "manual": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "Tamerlan Tsarnaev"}, {"question": "How was Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed?", "answer": " in a gunfight with police"}, {"question": " When was Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed?", "answer": "in the early hours of Friday"}, {"question": "", "answer": ""}], "gpt": [{"question": "Who was killed?", "answer": "Tamerlan Tsarnaev"}, {"question": "How was Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed?", "answer": "in a gunfight with police"}, {"question": "When was Tamerlan Tsarnaev killed?", "answer": "in the early hours of Friday"}, {"question": "What is the debate about?", "answer": "the political and religious beliefs of Tamerlan Tsarnaev"}], "kairos_argument": [{"entity_id": "backpack_ied_2-T3", "role": "Victim", "text": "suspect"}, {"entity_id": "backpack_ied_2-T4", "role": "Killer", "text": "police"}, {"entity_id": "backpack_ied_2-T2", "role": "Place", "text": "Boston Marathon"}, {"entity_id": "backpack_ied_2-T1", "role": "Victim", "text": "Tamerlan Tsarnaev"}]}, {"event_id": "backpack_ied_2-E2", "trigger": "contributed", "manual": [{"question": "Who contributed to the debate over the suspect's religious beliefs?", "answer": "a spokesman for the Islamic Society of Boston"}, {"question": "What was contributed by Tamerlan to the speech?

If convicted, Tsarnaev could face the death penalty.One week after the two bombings that wreaked havoc near the finish line of the Boston Marathon, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was formally charged in a Boston hospital room, where he remains in serious but stable condition.A statement from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said Tsarnaev is charged with using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction that resulted in death. A second charge of malicious destruction of property by an explosive device resulting in death also was filed. If he is found guilty of the federal charges, Tsarnaev might get the death penalty.Investigators reportedly have been questioning Tsarnaev, and he has been responding in writing. He is suffering from a gunshot wound to his throat. Officials say it is not clear if the wound was self-inflicted or came in the shootout with police in the Boston suburb of Watertown last week.Tsarnaev\u2019s older brother Tamerlan died in that same shootout.At the White House Monday, presidential spokesman Jay Carney said there is no doubt that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev eventually will face a trial in the civilian court system, and not through a military commission.Images of Boston Bombing SuspectsImages of Boston Bombing Suspects\u201cHe will not be treated as an enemy combatant. We will prosecute this terrorist through our civilian system of justice. Under U.S. law, United States citizens cannot be tried in military commissions and it is important to remember that since 9-11 we have used the federal court system to convict and incarcerate hundreds of terrorists,\u201d said Carney.Some Republican members of Congress have urged the Obama administration to designate Tsarnaev an enemy combatant for the purposes of more easily questioning him about his motivation for the Boston bombing, and whether he and his brother had links with terrorist groups.Senator Lindsay Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, spoke to reporters at the U.S. Capitol shortly after the criminal charges were announced.\u201cI hope that the administration will look long and hard at the evidence and keep on the table the ability to interrogate this suspect for intelligence gathering purposes about future attacks that we may face,\u201d said Graham.Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis told NBC\u2019s Today program that law enforcement officials are still trying to find out why the brothers allegedly carried out the bomb attacks last week.\u201cWe are satisfied that the two main actors, the people who were committing the damage out there, have been either captured or killed. There is still an open question as to exactly what happened in this investigation, and there are enormous investigative resources being poured into that right now,\u201d said Davis.Experienced investigators say the authorities in Boston will try to learn all they can from Tsarnaev through a variety of techniques.Vernon Herron is a retired major from the Maryland State Police, now with the Center for Health and Homeland Security at the University of Maryland.\u201cEverybody has certain triggers that will prompt them to give you information or not give you information,\" he said. \"I have always found it easier to get information from suspects when you didn\u2019t go in heavy-handed and when you spoke with them in a calm voice and tried to build a relationship with them long before you started asking them incriminating questions.\u201dBostonians took part in a moment of silence Monday to mark the one-week anniversary of the bombing attacks that killed three and wounded more than 180 others.Mourning and Recovery After the Boston Attacks", "events": [{"event_id": "46_VOA_EN_NW_2013.04.22.1646780-E1", "trigger": "charges", "manual": [{"question": "What is he charged for?", "answer": "bombing"}, {"question": "What type of charge does he face?", "answer": " U.

Memorial for Bombing VictimsBostonians have transformed the Boston Marathon finish line area into a memorial for the victims of this month's twin bombings.Dozens of people gathered at Boylston Street to lay flowers and display messages of hope for the victims.The memorial includes some of the same guard rails used during the April 15 marathon. Some people tied American flags to the rails and placed dozens of running shoes to show their support. Paper doves tied to nearby trees moved softly in the breeze.On Friday, the U.S. Marshals Service said Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was moved to a prison medical facility as authorities continued to search for information about the attack. The bombings killed three people and injured more than 250 others.Tsarnaev was moved to Federal Medical Center Devens from a Boston hospital, where he had been treated for injuries sustained during his capture last week.A spokesman did not give details about the condition of the 19-year-old, who officials say is recovering from a neck wound.Tsarnaev's brother and alleged co-conspirator, 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev, died in a confrontation with police last week.Also Friday, FBI agents searched for a laptop computer that is believed to belong to Dzhokar Tsarnaev. Agents in white hazmat suits scoured a landfill near the campus of the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, where Dzhokar was a student.In Washington, lawmakers said authorities are trying to determine whether or not the brothers' mother was involved in the radicalization of her two sons. The top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Dutch Ruppersberger, said she is a \"person of interest.\"The Associated Press reported Friday that the bombing suspects' mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, had been added to a federal terrorism database about 18 months before the Boston attack. She has denied her sons were involvement and has even suggested the bombing could have been staged.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev faces a charge of using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a possible death sentence if he is convicted.New York officials say the suspects were devising a plan to attack Times Square as they were running from authorities. New York Police Chief Ray Kelly says Dzhokhar told investigators they planned to drive to New York to set off their remaining explosives.He says the plan fell apart when they realized the vehicle they had hijacked was running low on gas. When they stopped to refuel, the driver of the car escaped, and alerted police to their location.U.S. investigators questioned the suspects' parents in the Russian republic of Dagestan to try to determine if Tamerlan had contacts with Islamic extremists. The family is originally from Chechnya, where Muslim insurgents have for decades been engaged in a bloody conflict with Russia.", "events": [{"event_id": "11_VOA_EN_NW_2013.04.27.1650105-E1", "trigger": "moved", "manual": [{"question": "Who was moved?", "answer": "Dzhokhar Tsarnaev"}, {"question": "Where was he moved to?", "answer": "Federal Medical Center Devens"}, {"question": "Where was he moved from?", "answer": "a Boston hospital"}, {"question": "When was he moved?", "answer": "On Friday"}, {"question": "Who moved him?", "answer": "U.

Nations Human Rights Council has called for independent investigations to be carried out into drone attacks after a series of strikes that result in unexpected civilian deaths in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Most of the attacks involved US drones.In a 21-page report, the UN special rapporteur on human rights, Ben Emmerson, records a dramatic reduction in drone strikes in 2013 in Pakistan but increases in Afghanistan and, towards the end of the year, in Yemen.The decline in drone strikes in Pakistan comes after its government's repeated calls for the US to reduce their number. Islamabad argued that the impact of drone strikes was counterproductive, turned opinion in the country against the US and undermined the Pakistani government.But Emmerson noted a threefold increase in recorded civilian casualties from drone strikes in Afghanistan in 2013. He concluded that states have an obligation to launch inquiries into cases in which civilians become caught up.His report said: \"Having regard to the duty of states to protect civilians in armed conflict, the special rapporteur concluded that in any case in which there have been, or appear to have been, civilian casualties that were not anticipated when the attack was planned, the state responsible is under an obligation to conduct a prompt, independent and impartial fact-finding inquiry and to provide a detailed public explanation of the results.\"This obligation would be triggered whenever there is a plausible indication from any apparently reliable source that unintended civilian casualties may have been sustained.\"The proposal is likely to form the basis for a draft resolution to be debated by the UNHRC in Geneva, Switzerland.Emmerson devoted a large part of the report to listing specific drone strikes involving civilians. He said he had identified 30 attacks out of a total of 37 brought to his attention in which civilians had been killed, suffered life-threatening injuries or been put at risk.In Afghanistan, Emmerson, who travelled widely for the report, said that up to the end of 2012 drone strikes \"appeared to have inflicted significantly lower levels of civilians casualties than aerial attacks carried out by other air platforms. This is no longer the position.\"In 2013, drone attacks accounted for 40% of the total number of civilian fatalities from air strikes. There were 45 civilian fatalities and 14 non-fatal injuries, a threefold increase compared with 2012.In Pakistan, he recorded \"a marked drop\" in civilian casualties since 2012. \"Figures to the end of 2013 confirm that there has been a significant de-escalation in the number of recorded drone strikes in Pakistan,\" he said. Strikes were down to 27 in 2013 from a peak of 128 in 2010, and for the first time in nine years there had been no civilian casualties reported.\"At the time of writing, there have been no reported drone strikes during 2014, the longest pause since President Obama took office,\" Emmerson said.The Bureau of Investigative Journalism, which monitors media reports on drones strikes, reported last month that there had been no known drone strikes in Pakistan since 25 December. US officials say the lull was a response to requests by the Pakistani government, which has been trying to launch peace talks with the Pakistani Taliban.In Yemen, Emmerson was told that the US routinely sought prior consent for attacks, although Human Rights Watch has quoted the Yemeni government as saying they were not pre-approved.In Israel, he said the government stressed it aimed for zero civilian casualties, saying it provided advance warning of attacks where possible. But Emmerson \"identified a number of sample strikes in which there are credible allegations that civilians were killed or injured as the result of Israeli drone strikes in Gaza\".Kat Craig, legal director of Reprieve, the legal charity which has been campaigning on the issue, said: \"In Yemen, Pakistan and elsewhere, the US, assisted by its European allies, is carrying out devastating attacks with total impunity \u2013 a practice that is terrorising local communities, and creating far more extremism than it has ever eliminated.\"It is high time that the US provided full accountability and transparency around its use of drones, and investigated civilian casualties.

Whereas President George W. Bush oversaw fewer than 50 drone strikes during his tenure, Obama has signed off on over 400 of them in the last four years, making the program the centerpiece of U.S. counterterrorism strategy. The drones have done their job remarkably well: by killing key leaders and denying terrorists sanctuaries in Pakistan, Yemen, and, to a lesser degree, Somalia, drones have devastated al Qaeda and associated anti-American militant groups. And they have done so at little financial cost, at no risk to U.S. forces, and with fewer civilian casualties than many alternative methods would have caused.Critics, however, remain skeptical. They claim that drones kill thousands of innocent civilians, alienate allied governments, anger foreign publics, illegally target Americans, and set a dangerous precedent that irresponsible governments will abuse. Some of these criticisms are valid; others, less so. In the end, drone strikes remain a necessary instrument of counterterrorism. The United States simply cannot tolerate terrorist safe havens in remote parts of Pakistan and elsewhere, and drones offer a comparatively low-risk way of targeting these areas while minimizing collateral damage.So drone warfare is here to stay, and it is likely to expand in the years to come as other countries\u2019 capabilities catch up with those of the United States. But Washington must continue to improve its drone policy, spelling out clearer rules for extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings so that tyrannical regimes will have a harder time pointing to the U.S. drone program to justify attacks against political opponents. At the same time, even as it solidifies the drone program, Washington must remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid.NOBODY DOES IT BETTERThe Obama administration relies on drones for one simple reason: they work. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation, since Obama has been in the White House, U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,300 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban\u2014top figures who are not easily replaced. In 2010, Osama bin Laden warned his chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman, who was later killed by a drone strike in the Waziristan region of Pakistan in 2011, that when experienced leaders are eliminated, the result is \u201cthe rise of lower leaders who are not as experienced as the former leaders\u201d and who are prone to errors and miscalculations. And drones also hurt terrorist organizations when they eliminate operatives who are lower down on the food chain but who boast special skills: passport forgers, bomb makers, recruiters, and fundraisers.Drones have also undercut terrorists\u2019 ability to communicate and to train new recruits. In order to avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda and Taliban operatives try to avoid using electronic devices or gathering in large numbers. A tip sheet found among jihadists in Mali advised militants to \u201cmaintain complete silence of all wireless contacts\u201d and \u201cavoid gathering in open areas.\u201d Leaders, however, cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire group of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda\u2019s command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders.Critics of drone strikes often fail to take into account the fact that the alternatives are either too risky or unrealistic. To be sure, in an ideal world, militants would be captured alive, allowing authorities to question them and search their compounds for useful information. Raids, arrests, and interrogations can produce vital intelligence and can be less controversial than lethal operations. That is why they should be, and indeed already are, used in stable countries where the United States enjoys the support of the host government. But in war zones or unstable countries, such as Pakistan, Yemen, and Somalia, arresting militants is highly dangerous and, even if successful, often inefficient. In those three countries, the government exerts little or no control over remote areas, which means that it is highly dangerous to go after militants hiding out there. Worse yet, in Pakistan and Yemen, the governments have at times cooperated with militants. If the United States regularly sent in special operations forces to hunt down terrorists there, sympathetic officials could easily tip off the jihadists, likely leading to firefights, U.S. casualties, and possibly the deaths of the suspects and innocent civilians.Of course, it was a Navy SEAL team and not a drone strike that finally got bin Laden, but in many cases in which the United States needs to capture or eliminate an enemy, raids are too risky and costly. And even if a raid results in a successful capture, it begets another problem: what to do with the detainee. Prosecuting detainees in a federal or military court is difficult because often the intelligence against terrorists is inadmissible or using it risks jeopardizing sources and methods. And given the fact that the United States is trying to close, rather than expand, the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba, it has become much harder to justify holding suspects indefinitely. It has become more politically palatable for the United States to kill rather than detain suspected terrorists.Furthermore, although a drone strike may violate the local state\u2019s sovereignty, it does so to a lesser degree than would putting U.S. boots on the ground or conducting a large-scale air campaign. And compared with a 500-pound bomb dropped from an F-16, the grenadelike warheads carried by most drones create smaller, more precise blast zones that decrease the risk of unexpected structural damage and casualties. Even more important, drones, unlike traditional airplanes, can loiter above a target for hours, waiting for the ideal moment to strike and thus reducing the odds that civilians will be caught in the kill zone.Finally, using drones is also far less bloody than asking allies to hunt down terrorists on the United States\u2019 behalf. The Pakistani and Yemeni militaries, for example, are known to regularly torture and execute detainees, and they often indiscriminately bomb civilian areas or use scorched-earth tactics against militant groups.Some critics of the drone program, such as Ben Emmerson, the UN\u2019s special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, have questioned the lethal approach, arguing for more focus on the factors that might contribute to extremism and terrorism, such as poverty, unemployment, and authoritarianism. Such a strategy is appealing in principle, but it is far from clear how Washington could execute it. Individuals join anti-American terrorist groups for many reasons, ranging from outrage over U.S. support for Israel to anger at their own government\u2019s cooperation with the United States. Some people simply join up because their neighbors are doing so. Slashing unemployment in Yemen, bringing democracy to Saudi Arabia, and building a functioning government in Somalia are laudable goals, but they are not politically or financially possible for the United States, and even if achieved, they still might not reduce the allure of jihad.In some cases, the most sensible alternative to carrying out drone strikes is to do nothing at all. At times, that is the right option: if militants abroad pose little threat or if the risk of killing civilians, delegitimizing allies, or establishing the wrong precedent is too high. But sometimes imminent and intolerable threats do arise and drone strikes are the best way to eliminate them.THE NUMBERS GAMEDespite the obvious benefits of using drones and the problems associated with the alternatives, numerous critics argue that drones still have too many disadvantages. First among them is an unacceptably high level of civilian casualties. Admittedly, drones have killed innocents. But the real debate is over how many and whether alternative approaches are any better. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reports that in 2011, drone strikes killed as many as 146 noncombatants, including as many as 9 children. Columbia Law School\u2019s Human Rights Clinic also cites high numbers of civilian deaths, as does the Pakistani organization Pakistan Body Count. Peter Bergen of the New America Foundation oversees a database of drone casualties culled from U.S. sources and international media reports. He estimates that between 150 and 500 civilians have been killed by drones during Obama\u2019s administration. U.S. officials, meanwhile, maintain that drone strikes have killed almost no civilians. In June 2011, John Brennan, then Obama\u2019s top counterterrorism adviser, even contended that U.S. drone strikes had killed no civilians in the previous year. But these claims are based on the fact that the U.S. government assumes that all military-age males in the blast area of a drone strike are combatants\u2014 unless it can determine after the fact that they were innocent (and such intelligence gathering is not a priority).The United States has recently taken to launching \u201csignature strikes,\u201d which target not specific individuals but instead groups engaged in suspicious activities. This approach makes it even more difficult to distinguish between combatants and civilians and verify body counts of each. Still, as one U.S. official told The New York Times last year, \u201cAl Qaeda is an insular, paranoid organization\u2014innocent neighbors don\u2019t hitchhike rides in the back of trucks headed for the border with guns and bombs.\u201d Of course, not everyone accepts this reasoning. Zeeshan-ul-hassan Usmani, who runs Pakistan Body Count, says that \u201cneither [the United States] nor Pakistan releases any detailed information about the victims . . . so [although the United States] likes to call everybody Taliban, I call everybody civilians.\u201dThe truth is that all the public numbers are unreliable. Who constitutes a civilian is often unclear; when trying to kill the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, for example, the United States also killed his doctor. The doctor was not targeting U.S. or allied forces, but he was aiding a known terrorist leader. In addition, most strikes are carried out in such remote locations that it is nearly impossible for independent sources to verify who was killed. In Pakistan, for example, the overwhelming majority of drone killings occur in tribal areas that lie outside the government\u2019s control and are prohibitively dangerous for Westerners and independent local journalists to enter. Thus, although the New America Foundation has come under fire for relying heavily on unverifiable information provided by anonymous U.S. officials, reports from local Pakistani organizations, and the Western organizations that rely on them, are no better: their numbers are frequently doctored by the Pakistani government or by militant groups. After a strike in Pakistan, militants often cordon off the area, remove their dead, and admit only local reporters sympathetic to their cause or decide on a body count themselves. The U.S. media often then draw on such faulty reporting to give the illusion of having used multiple sources. As a result, statistics on civilians killed by drones are often inflated. One of the few truly independent on-the-ground reporting efforts, conducted by the Associated Press last year, concluded that the strikes \u201care killing far fewer civilians than many in [Pakistan] are led to believe.\u201dBut even the most unfavorable estimates of drone casualties reveal that the ratio of civilian to militant deaths\u2014about one to three, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism\u2014is lower than it would be for other forms of strikes. Bombings by F-16s or Tomahawk cruise missile salvos, for example, pack a much more deadly payload. In December 2009, the United States fired Tomahawks at a suspected terrorist training camp in Yemen, and over 30 people were killed in the blast, most of them women and children. At the time, the Yemeni regime refused to allow the use of drones, but had this not been the case, a drone\u2019s real-time surveillance would probably have spotted the large number of women and children, and the attack would have been aborted. Even if the strike had gone forward for some reason, the drone\u2019s far smaller warhead would have killed fewer innocents. Civilian deaths are tragic and pose political problems. But the data show that drones are more discriminate than other types of force.FOREIGN FRIENDSIt is also telling that drones have earned the backing, albeit secret, of foreign governments. In order to maintain popular support, politicians in Pakistan and Yemen routinely rail against the U.S. drone campaign. In reality, however, the governments of both countries have supported it. During the Bush and Obama administrations, Pakistan has even periodically hosted U.S. drone facilities and has been told about strikes in advance. Pervez Musharraf, president of Pakistan until 2008, was not worried about the drone program\u2019s negative publicity: \u201cIn Pakistan, things fall out of the sky all the time,\u201d he reportedly remarked. Yemen\u2019s former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, also at times allowed drone strikes in his country and even covered for them by telling the public that they were conducted by the Yemeni air force. When the United States\u2019 involvement was leaked in 2002, however, relations between the two countries soured. Still, Saleh later let the drone program resume in Yemen, and his replacement, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has publicly praised drones, saying that \u201cthey pinpoint the target and have zero margin of error, if you know what target you\u2019re aiming at.\u201dAs officials in both Pakistan and Yemen realize, U.S. drone strikes help their governments by targeting common enemies. A memo released by the antisecrecy website WikiLeaks revealed that Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Ashfaq Parvez kayani, privately asked U.S. military leaders in 2008 for \u201ccontinuous Predator coverage\u201d over antigovernment militants, and the journalist Mark Mazzetti has reported that the United States has conducted \u201cgoodwill kills\u201d against Pakistani militants who threatened Pakistan far more than the United States. Thus, in private, Pakistan supports the drone program. As then Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani told Anne Patterson, then the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, in 2008, \u201cWe\u2019ll protest [against the drone program] in the National Assembly and then ignore it.\u201dStill, Pakistan is reluctant to make its approval public. First of all, the country\u2019s inability to fight terrorists on its own soil is a humiliation for Pakistan\u2019s politically powerful armed forces and intelligence service. In addition, although drones kill some of the government\u2019s enemies, they have also targeted pro-government groups that are hostile to the United States, such as the Haqqani network and the Taliban, which Pakistan has supported since its birth in the early 1990s. Even more important, the Pakistani public is vehemently opposed to U.S. drone strikes.A 2012 poll found that 74 percent of Pakistanis viewed the United States as their enemy, likely in part because of the ongoing drone campaign. Similarly, in Yemen, as the scholar Gregory Johnsen has pointed out, drone strikes can win the enmity of entire tribes. This has led critics to argue that the drone program is shortsighted: that it kills today\u2019s enemies but creates tomorrow\u2019s in the process.Such concerns are valid, but the level of local anger over drones is often lower than commonly portrayed. Many surveys of public opinion related to drones are conducted by anti-drone organizations, which results in biased samples. Other surveys exclude those who are unaware of the drone program and thus overstate the importance of those who are angered by it. In addition, many Pakistanis do not realize that the drones often target the very militants who are wreaking havoc on their country. And for most Pakistanis and Yemenis, the most important problems they struggle with are corruption, weak representative institutions, and poor economic growth; the drone program is only a small part of their overall anger, most of which is directed toward their own governments. A poll conducted in 2007, well before the drone campaign had expanded to its current scope, found that only 15 percent of Pakistanis had a favorable opinion of the United States. It is hard to imagine that alternatives to drone strikes, such as seal team raids or cruise missile strikes, would make the United States more popular.THE HOME FRONTStill, public opposition is real, and there is growing concern about the drone strikes even in the United States. The program came under especially heavy criticism domestically in 2011, when Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen born in New Mexico, was killed by a drone strike in Yemen. There is no question that Awlaki was dangerous. Adept at interspersing Islamist rhetoric with pop-culture references, Awlaki had been described as a \u201cpied piper for Western ears\u201d: one admirer was Nidal Malik Hasan, the U.S. Army officer who killed 13 U.S. soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009.The Obama administration claims that Awlaki was actively involved in plots against the United States and that the strike against him was legal under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF), which Congress passed three days after 9/11 and which gives the president broad authority to use force against terrorist groups linked to the 9/11 attacks. Yet with the war on terrorism almost 12 years old and bin Laden dead, critics, such as the Georgetown University law professor Rosa Brooks, have begun questioning whether the AUMF still justifies drone strikes today. As Brooks has argued, \u201cMany of the groups now being identified as threats don\u2019t fall clearly under the AUMF\u2019s umbrella\u2014and many don\u2019t pose a significant danger to the United States.\u201d As for the case of Awlaki, opponents of his killing have argued that he did not pose an imminent threat to the United States and that in keeping the evidence used to justify his assassination secret, the administration violated the constitutional guarantee of due process for U.S. citizens. As Ron Paul, then a Texas representative, pointed out during his presidential campaign, Awlaki was never charged with any crime. He added, \u201cIf the American people accept this blindly and casually, that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys, I think it\u2019s sad.\u201dThe administration contends that the discussions held within the executive branch and the extensive vetting of evidence constitute a form of due process. Meanwhile, as the legal scholar Benjamin Wittes has pointed out, both Congress and the federal courts have repeatedly reaffirmed the validity of the AUMF since 2001. The U.S. government argues that given how secretly terrorists operate, it is not always possible to use other means to stop an individual overseas from planning attacks on U.S. forces or allies. As a result, the imminence of a threat should be assessed based on the individual\u2019s propensity for violence and the likelihood of being able to stop him in the future. Wittes compares the decision-making process to that used in hostage situations, when police are not required to ask a judge for authority to kill a hostage taker or refrain from taking a clear shot if they have one. Perhaps most important, the White House has claimed only a very limited right to conduct drone strikes against U.S. citizens. The administration has asserted the authority to kill only senior al Qaeda leaders who cannot be captured, not any American member of al Qaeda. Indeed, it appears that Awlaki is the only U.S. citizen who has been deliberately killed by a drone.?FOLLOW THE LEADERThe fact remains that by using drones so much, Washington risks setting a troublesome precedent with regard to extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings. Zeke Johnson of Amnesty International contends that \u201cwhen the U.S. government violates international law, that sets a precedent and provides an excuse for the rest of the world to do the same.\u201d And it is alarming to think what leaders such as Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has used deadly force against peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators he has deemed terrorists, would do with drones of their own. Similarly, Iran could mockingly cite the U.S. precedent to justify sending drones after rebels in Syria. Even Brennan has conceded that the administration is \u201cestablishing precedents that other nations may follow.\u201dControlling the spread of drone technology will prove impossible; that horse left the barn years ago. Drones are highly capable weapons that are easy to produce, and so there is no chance that Washington can stop other militaries from acquiring and using them. Nearly 90 other countries already have surveillance drones in their arsenals, and China is producing several inexpensive models for export. Armed drones are more difficult to produce and deploy, but they, too, will likely spread rapidly. Beijing even recently announced (although later denied) that it had considered sending a drone to Myanmar (also called Burma) to kill a wanted drug trafficker hiding there.The spread of drones cannot be stopped, but the United States can still influence how they are used. The coming proliferation means that Washington needs to set forth a clear policy now on extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings of terrorists\u2014and stick to it. Fortunately, Obama has begun to discuss what constitutes a legitimate drone strike. But the definition remains murky, and this murkiness will undermine the president\u2019s ability to denounce other countries\u2019 behavior should they start using drones or other means to hunt down enemies. By keeping its policy secret, Washington also makes it easier for critics to claim that the United States is wantonly slaughtering innocents. More transparency would make it harder for countries such as Pakistan to make outlandish claims about what the United States is doing. Drones actually protect many Pakistanis, and Washington should emphasize this fact. By being more open, the administration could also show that it carefully considers the law and the risks to civilians before ordering a strike.Washington needs to be especially open about its use of signature strikes. According to the Obama administration, signature strikes have eliminated not only low-level al Qaeda and Taliban figures but also a surprising number of higher-level officials whose presence at the scenes of the strikes was unexpected. Signature strikes are in keeping with traditional military practice; for the most part, U.S. soldiers have been trained to strike enemies at large, such as German soldiers or Vietcong guerrillas, and not specific individuals. The rise of unconventional warfare, however, has made this usual strategy more difficult because the battlefield is no longer clearly defined and enemies no longer wear identifiable uniforms, making combatants harder to distinguish from civilians. In the case of drones, where there is little on-the-ground knowledge of who is who, signature strikes raise legitimate concerns, especially because the Obama administration has not made clear what its rules and procedures for such strikes are.Washington should exercise particular care with regard to signature strikes because mistakes risk tarnishing the entire drone program. In the absence of other information, the argument that drones are wantonly killing innocents is gaining traction in the United States and abroad. More transparency could help calm these fears that Washington is acting recklessly.The U.S. government also needs to guard against another kind of danger: that the relative ease of using drones will make U.S. intervention abroad too common. The scholars Daniel Brunstetter and Megan Braun have argued that drones provide \u201ca way to avoid deploying troops or conducting an intensive bombing campaign\u201d and that this \u201cmay encourage countries to act on just cause with an ease that is potentially worrisome.\u201d Although al Qaeda remains a threat, it has been substantially defanged since 9/11, thanks to the destruction of its haven in Afghanistan and effective global police, intelligence, and drone campaigns against its cells. In addition, the U.S. government needs to remember that many of the world\u2019s jihadist organizations are focused first and foremost on local regimes and that although the United States has an interest in helping its allies fight extremists, Washington cannot and should not directly involve itself in every fight. The Obama administration should spell out those cases in which the AUMF does not apply and recognize the risks of carrying out so-called goodwill kills on behalf of foreign governments. Helping French and Malian forces defeat jihadists in Mali by providing logistical support, for example, is smart policy, but sending U.S. drones there is not.In places where terrorists are actively plotting against the United States, however, drones give Washington the ability to limit its military commitments abroad while keeping Americans safe. Afghanistan, for example, could again become a Taliban-run haven for terrorists after U.S. forces depart next year. Drones can greatly reduce the risk of this happening. Hovering in the skies above, they can keep Taliban leaders on the run and hinder al Qaeda\u2019s ability to plot another 9/11.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_2_news_4-E1", "trigger":

Birmingham pub bombings is calling for inquests to be held for the victims.There have been no inquests since two bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town in November 1974, which also injured 182 people.Human rights lawyer Kevin Winters said he will be writing to West Midlands Police and the relevant coroner.Inquests would allow access to certain material never before disclosed.Six men, later dubbed the Birmingham Six, were jailed in 1975 but their convictions were quashed in 1991.Families of the victims have criticised police, accusing them of withholding information over the years and say 40 years on from the bombings they still do not have the answers they need.Calls for a fresh investigation into what happened were denied by West Midlands Police in April.Speaking exclusively to BBC Radio WM ahead of the 40th anniversary next week , Mr Winters, who has represented families of victims of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, said inquests would have been put off because of legal proceedings against the Six but \"uniquely we now know the wrong people were put behind bars.\"image caption Twenty-one people were killed when bombs exploded at the

up before now and said anything?,\" Ms Hambleton said.image copyright (C) British Broadcasting Corporation image caption Julie Hambleton said she feels she has not been given the answers she needs

said the families also had no recourse to remedies available to those affected by the Troubles in Ireland.Inquests would provide families with access to certain \"disclosure materials\" that he said had been kept from them.\"In my view, and our view, there is a basis for an inquest and we're now going to be writing to West Midlands Police and the relevant coronial services in England through our agencies in London to invite a new inquest.\"In response, Chief Constable Chris Sims said: \"Nothing would give me more satisfaction than to bring those responsible for this atrocity to
