{"scenario_en_kairos_68": {"text": "Thank you, your Honor, for giving me an opportunity to speak. I would like to begin in the name of Allah, the exalted and glorious, the most gracious, the most merciful, \u201cAllah\u201d among the most beautiful names. Any act that does not begin in the name of God is separate from goodness.This is the blessed month of Ramadan, and it is the month of mercy from Allah to his creation, a month to ask forgiveness of Allah and of his creation, a month to express gratitude to Allah and to his creation. It\u2019s the month of reconciliation, a month of patience, a month during which hearts change. Indeed, a month of many blessings.The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said if you have not thanked the people, you have not thanked God. So I would like to first thank my attorneys, those who sit at this table, the table behind me, and many more behind the scenes. They have done much good for me, for my family. They made my life the last two years very easy. I cherish their company. They\u2019re lovely companions. I thank you.AdvertisementI would like to thank those who took time out of their daily lives to come and testify on my behalf despite the pressure. I\u2019d like to thank the jury for their service, and the Court. The Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him, said that if you do not -- if you are not merciful to Allah\u2019s creation, Allah will not be merciful to you, so I\u2019d like to now apologize to the victims, to the survivors.AdvertisementImmediately after the bombing, which I am guilty of -- if there\u2019s any lingering doubt about that, let there be no more. I did do it along with my brother -- I learned of some of the victims. I learned their names, their faces, their age. And throughout this trial more of those victims were given names, more of those victims had faces, and they had burdened souls.Now, all those who got up on that witness stand and that podium related to us -- to me -- I was listening -- the suffering that was and the hardship that still is, with strength and with patience and with dignity. Now, Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that no soul is burdened with more than it can bear, and you told us just how unbearable it was, how horrendous it was, this thing I put you through. And I know that you kept that much. I know that there isn\u2019t enough time in the day for you to have related to us everything. I also wish that far more people had a chance to get up there, but I took them from you.Now, I am sorry for the lives that I\u2019ve taken, for the suffering that I\u2019ve caused you, for the damage that I\u2019ve done. Irreparable damage.Now, I am a Muslim. My religion is Islam. The God I worship, besides whom there is no other God, is Allah. And I prayed for Allah to bestow his mercy upon the deceased, those affected in the bombing and their families. Allah says in the Qur\u2019an that with every hardship there is relief. I pray for your relief, for your healing, for your well-being, for your strength.AdvertisementI ask Allah to have mercy upon me and my brother and my family. I ask Allah to bestow his mercy upon those present here today. And Allah knows best those deserving of his mercy. And I ask Allah to have mercy upon the ummah of Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him. Amin. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.Thank you.Milton J.

Bush.Obama embraced the US drone programme, overseeing more strikes in his first year than Bush carried out during his entire presidency. A total of 563 strikes, largely by drones, targeted Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen during Obama\u2019s two terms, compared to 57 strikes under Bush. Between 384 and 807 civilians were killed in those countries, according to reports logged by the Bureau.The use of drones aligned with Obama\u2019s ambition to keep up the war against al Qaeda while extricating the US military from intractable, costly ground wars in the Middle East and Asia. But the targeted killing programme has drawn much criticism.The Obama administration has insisted that drone strikes are so \u201cexceptionally surgical and precise\u201d that they pluck off terror suspects while not putting \u201cinnocent men, women and children in danger\u201d. This claim has been contested by numerous human rights groups, however, and the Bureau\u2019s figures on civilian casualties also demonstrate that this is often not the case.The White House released long-awaited figures last July on the number of people killed in drone strikes between January 2009 and the end of 2015, an announcement which insiders said was a direct response to pressure from the Bureau and other organisations that collect data. However the US\u2019s estimate of the number of civilians killed \u2013 between 64 and 116 \u2013 contrasted strongly with the number recorded by the Bureau, which at 380 to 801 was six times higher.That figure does not include deaths in active battlefields including Afghanistan \u2013 where US air attacks have shot up since Obama withdrew the majority of his troops at the end of 2014. The country has since come under frequent US bombardment, in an unreported war that saw 1,337 weapons dropped last year alone \u2013 a 40% rise on 2015.Afghan civilian casualties have been high, with the United Nations (UN) reporting at least 85 deaths in 2016. The Bureau recorded 65 to 105 civilian deaths during this period. We did not start collecting data on Afghanistan until 2015.Pakistan was the hub of drone operations during Obama\u2019s first term. The pace of attacks had accelerated in the second half of 2008 at the end of Bush\u2019s term, after four years pocked by occasional strikes. However in the year after taking office, Obama ordered more drone strikes than Bush did during his entire presidency. The 54 strikes in 2009 all took place in Pakistan.", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_drone_strikes_0_news_1-E1", "trigger": "strikes", "manual": [], "gpt": [{"question": "What is the trigger word?",

There were no fatalities but 33 people were injured, some severely. Two off-duty soldiers lost their legs as a result of the bombing.==Background==In February 1975 the Provisional Irish Republican Army agreed to a truce and ceasefire with the British government and the Northern Ireland Office. Seven \"incident centres\" were established in Irish nationalist areas in Northern Ireland to monitor the ceasefire and the activity of the security forces. Before the truce, the IRA active service unit (ASU) later dubbed the Balcombe Street Gang (due to the December 1975 Balcombe Street siege) had been carrying out bomb and gun attacks in Southern England since autumn 1974, mostly in and around London. Their last previous attack was an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Edward Heath but he was not home when the attackers threw a bomb into his bedroom window on 22 December 1974.==The bombing==The Balcombe Street Gang planted a time bomb in the Caterham Arms public house in Caterham, Surrey. The IRA unit placed the 7lb bomb in a duffel bag under a seat. There was no warning and the bomb exploded at 9:20, injuring 23 civilians and 10 off-duty soldiers. The pub was used by members of the Welsh Guards who were based at the barracks nearby. Some of the injuries were very serious, with at least three soldiers losing limbs. The blast blew the roof off the pub in the process. This attack marked the start of a renewed bombing campaign (Phase Two) in England and the end of the truce with the British Government. The next day, the same IRA unit exploded a bomb in Oxford Street, injuring several people.==Aftermath==One of the police officers in charge of the investigation into the bombing described it as a \"carbon copy\" of the Guildford pub bombings in October 1974 for which four people were already serving their sentences. The cell's campaign would continue until December 1975 when they were caught at the siege of Balcombe Street. The unit would eventually end up planting close to 50 bombs in London and elsewhere in southern England and carrying out several shootings which, along with the bombings, caused the deaths of nearly 20 people, injured hundreds and caused millions of pounds worth of damage to property.==See also==*Chronology of Provisional Irish Republican Army actions (1970\u201379)== References ==", "events":

{"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The threat from multiple homemade bombs detonated nearly simultaneously to kill or maim as many civilians as possible has been a hallmark of militant groups in recent years from Iraq to Israel and Afghanistan and Russia.But until Monday at the Boston Marathon finish line in Copley Square, such street-level bombings targeting sidewalk or marketplace crowds had not taken place on American soil.US law enforcement and intelligence officials across the country and overseas, scrambling to identify the source of the explosives, are now worried that the marathon sidewalk bombing could mark a new chapter in the struggle to secure the American homeland.Advertisement\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this around the world, but what is so concerning about this is that it hadn\u2019t happened here, not like this.Until yesterday,\u2019\u2019 said a senior homeland security official in Washington.The Boston bombs were packed into pressure cookers and hidden in backpacks or duffel bags, according to multiple press accounts citing unidentified sources, another similarity with some Mideast attacks using \u201cimprovised explosive devices,\u2019\u2019 or IEDs.One of the bombs used in a foiled attack in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 was fashioned from a pressure cooker.A joint warning issued by the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security in 2010 said pressure cookers has been used for bombs in multiple attacks in Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Nepal.Reports from medical staff at Boston hospitals who treated victims in the marathon attack indicate the bombs in this case were packed with BB\u2019s, nails, and other projectiles intended to maximize human carnage.That contrasts with the large truck bombs that were used in Oklahoma City in 1995 and in the garage of the World Trade Center North Tower in 1993, which were intended to inflict damage on buildings, as well as people.IED\u2019s pack a much smaller punch, are cheaper, and easier to carry.They have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan with devastating effect on American troops in convoys of military vehicles.AdvertisementNo one has taken responsibility for the twin bombings on Boylston Street that killed three people and injured more than 150 near the Boston marathon finish line.A senior US law enforcement official in Washington added that the fact that no group has taken responsibility has officials speculating that it might not be the work of a well-known international terrorist group like Al Qaeda, Hezbollah or one of its affiliates but a domestic group or individual inspired by the hallmark tactics of terrorist groups in recent years,The Pakistani Taliban also said in a statement it was not responsible for the attack, unlike the attempted car bombing in New York\u2019s Times Square in 2010 that it claimed responsibility for.But officials in Washington have been warning about the possibility of so-called improvised explosive devises in recent weeks.In late february the White House established a new task force housed in the Department of Justice to apply the lessons learned from years of dealing with so-called improvised explosive devices \u2014 some large and powerful and others more limited in scope like the ones apparently set off on Boylston Street yesterday.\u201cThe threat from IED use is likely to remain high in the near future, and will continue to evolve in response to our abilities to counter them,\u2019\u2019 according to a new strategy approved by President Obama on February 26.\u201cA whole-of-government approach that integrates Federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, private sector, and global participation in counter-IED activities will best position the United States to discover plots to use IEDs in the United States, or against U.S. persons abroad, before those threats become imminent.\u2019\u2019AdvertisementThe 2010 warning from the FBI and Homeland Security said \u201cterrorists can exploit the innocuous appearance of easily transportable items such as pressure cookers to conceal IED components.Placed carefully, such devices provide little or no indication of an impending attack.\u2019\u2019\u201cAlertness and quick reaction to discovery of such concealment devices in unusual locations or circumstances can improve chances of early detection and prevention of an attack,\u2019\u2019 the warning continued.Potential indicators of a pressure cooker configured as an IED include protruding wires or fuses, unusual smells such as chemical odors, and wetness or unusual stains on a container.A magazine published during the last decade by Al Qaeda provided bomb-making tips that included using pressure cookers.Instructions for building such bombs also are contained on other websites, including one site that bills itself as an \u201canarchist cookbook.\u2019\u2019", "events": [{"event_id": "backpack_ied_20-E1", "trigger": "bombing", "manual":

across Iraq on Monday killed 107 people in the country's deadliest day in more than two years after al-Qaida warned it would mount new attacks and sought to retake territory.Officials said at least 214 people were wounded in 27 different attacks launched in 18 cities, shattering a relative calm which had held in the lead-up to the start on Saturday of the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.In Monday's deadliest attack -- a string of roadside bombs and a car bomb followed by a suicide attack targeting emergency responders in the town of Taji -- at least 42 people were killed and 40 wounded, according to two medical officials.\"I heard explosions in the distance so I left my house and I saw a car outside,\" said 40-year-old Taji resident Abu Mohammed, who added that police inspectors concluded the vehicle was a car bomb.\"We asked the neighbors to leave their houses, but when they were leaving, the bomb went off.\"Abu Mohammed said he witnessed the deaths of an elderly woman carrying a newborn baby and of the policeman who had first concluded the car was packed with explosives.An Agence France Presse reporter at the scene said a row of houses were completely destroyed, and residents were rummaging through the rubble in search of victims and their belongings.In Baghdad, meanwhile, a car bomb outside a government office responsible for producing identity papers in the Shiite bastion of Sadr City killed at least 12 people and wounded 22 others, security and medical officials said.\"This attack is a terrible crime against humanity, because they did it during Ramadan, while people are fasting,\" said one elderly witness who declined to be identified.An AFP journalist said eight nearby cars were badly burned and many of the victims of the 9:30 am (0630 GMT) attack could not be identified because their papers were inside the offices that were targeted.Two other explosions in the Baghdad neighborhoods of Husseiniyah and Yarmouk killed at least four people and left 24 others wounded, while a car bomb in the town of Tarmiyah, just north of Baghdad, hurt nine people, officials said.Checkpoint shootings and bomb blasts in restive ethnically-mixed Diyala province killed 11 people and left 40 others wounded, security officials and doctor Ahmed Ibrahim from the main hospital in provincial capital Baquba said.Insurgents also launched attacks on a military base near the town of Dhuluiyah, killing at least 15 Iraqi soldiers and leaving two others wounded, according to two security officials.Two other attacks in the same province -- a shooting at a checkpoint and a car bomb near a Shiite mosque -- left three people dead and six wounded, officials said.Nine bomb blasts, some of them minutes apart, meanwhile killed seven people and wounded 29 in Kirkuk city and the eponymous province's towns of Dibis and Tuz Khurmatu.Three different attacks -- a car bomb, a roadside blast and a shooting -- in the main northern city of Mosul and the nearby town of Baaj left nine people dead and seven wounded, according to Iraqi army First Lieutenant Waad Mohammed and police Lieutenant Mohammed al-Juburi.A roadside bomb at a market in the center of the town of Diwaniyah, south of Baghdad, killed three people and left 25 hurt, provincial health chief Adnan Turki said.In the western town of Heet, a car bomb exploded near an army patrol, killing one soldier and wounding 10 others, according to an Iraqi army captain and doctor Abdulwahab al-Shammari from the town hospital.The attacks came a day after a spate of bombings across Iraq killed at least 17 people and wounded nearly 100 others. Monday's toll was the highest since May 10, 2010, when 110 people were killed.The latest violence comes after the country suffered a spike in unrest in June when at least 282 people were killed, according to an AFP tally based on figures supplied by officials and medics, although government figures said 131 Iraqis died.Although those figures are markedly lower than during the peak of Iraq's communal bloodshed from 2006 to 2008, attacks remain common.There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Monday's attacks, but al-Qaida's front group in Iraq has warned in recent days that it seeks to retake territory in the country.The Islamic State of Iraq warned in an audio message posted on various jihadist forums that it would begin targeting judges and prosecutors, and appealed for the help of Sunni tribes in its quest to recapture territory it once held.\"We are starting a new stage,\" said the voice on the message, purportedly that of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who has been leader of the Islamic State of Iraq since May 2010.\"The first priority in this is releasing Muslim prisoners everywhere, and chasing and eliminating judges and investigators and their guards.\"It was not possible to verify whether the voice was that of Baghdadi.The speaker added: \"On the occasion of the beginning of the return of the state to the areas that we left, I urge you to carry out more efforts, and send your sons with the mujahedeen to defend your religion and obey God.\"", "events": [{"event_id": "wiki_mass_car_bombings_7_news_2-E1", "trigger": "attacks", "manual": [], "gpt":

group.Conservative President Ivan Duque urged Communist-ruled Cuba, a host and one of the guarantors of the peace process, to send home the ELN rebels in Havana.Cuba\u2019s foreign minister said in a tweet late on Friday that the country would respect the protocols of the negotiations it had been hosting and was consulting with both parties and the guarantors of the talks.On Friday, Colombia blamed the leftist ELN for the bombing of a police academy in Bogota that killed 20 people as well as the attacker, dealing a big blow to the peace process.190102132047518Duque then announced that he was reinstating arrest warrants for 10 ELN members, who are part of the group\u2019s delegation to the Cuba talks.The talks were aimed at ending more than five decades of fighting by the Marxist-inspired group. Duque said that Cuba must not protect the rebels.The police academy car bombing \u201cwas a crime that violated human rights and no such act deserves [Cuba acting] to avoid justice being done\u201d, Duque said while giving a speech in Tolima.Colombians, including Duque, planned to join in a march on Sunday to protest against the car bombing, the worst such attack in the country in 16 years.Last rebel groupIn November, Colombia asked Cuba to capture ELN rebel commander Nicolas Rodriguez and provide information about the presence of other commanders in the Cuban territory.The government in Bogota also asked Havana to act on an Interpol Red Notice against Rodriguez. The Cuban government did not respond publicly to that request or made a statement about the issue.Colombia has experienced several years of relative calm since the 2016 peace accord signed by then-President Juan Manuel Santos and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) fighters.190118182118648With the landmark agreement turning the former rebels into a political party, the smaller ELN is considered the last active rebel group in the country.True to his election promises, Duque has taken a hard line against the ELN.Peace talks with the ELN began in February 2017 under Santos, but Duque has put them on hold until the rebels free all their hostages and stop attacks on military and civilian targets.The group is believed to be currently holding 17 hostages, some of

drone with low-level radioactive sand on the roof of the prime minister's office to protest the government's nuclear energy policy, officials said Saturday.Tokyo metropolitan police said Yasuo Yamamoto, 40, turned himself in to authorities late Friday in Fukui in western Japan.The small drone found Wednesday had traces of radiation and triggered fears of potential terrorist attacks using unmanned aerial devices, the prime ministers' office has said. The infiltration at Japan's political headquarters has also raised questions over the level of security there.No one was injured and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was traveling at the time of the incident.Police said Yamamoto was arrested on suspicion of flying the drone and obstructing duties at the prime minister's office. He has not been indicted and faces further questioning.Public broadcaster NHK said police quoted the unemployed man as saying he did it to protest the government's nuclear energy policy.Fukui is home to about a quarter of Japan's 48 reactors, which are currently all offline following the 2011 tsunami-triggered Fukushima plant disaster. Abe's administration wants to restart as many of the idled plants as possible.The drone was carrying a small camera and a plastic bottle containing what police suspect was the source of radioactive cesium, levels of which were too low to affect humans or the environment.The suspect said he used the sand from an unspecified location in Fukushima, where radiation levels are still high due to fallouts from the Fukushima Dai-ichi meltdowns, NHK said.The government has set up a task force to work on regulations for the use of small drones while ensuring the security of key government facilities. Drones have become increasingly popular in Japan for industrial, service and entertainment use. At a meeting Friday, task force members cautioned against excessive restrictions on the emerging market for drones.It is not clear exactly when the drone landed because workers at the office in central Tokyo rarely go up to the roof. An official taking new employees on a building tour reportedly spotted the drone.A blog with an anti-nuclear theme managed under the name \"Kantei (prime minister's office) Santa\" contained photos of a drone that looked like the one found Wednesday. In one entry, the anonymous writer said he drove from his hometown in Obama city in Fukui to Tokyo and flew the drone in the early hours of April 9, trying to have it land in the yard of the prime minister's office, but that he eventually lost track of the device.In the United States in January, a drone flown by an off-duty intelligence employee crashed on the White House grounds.", "events":

Anti-drone unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are to be taken for counter-terrorist test flights on a UK military base, E & T has learned. It is understood they will be flown in exercises designed to simulate a real-life pursuit of a terrorist drone. Police and the military are believed to be concerned about the prospect of terrorists modifying small, off-the-shelf drones to launch <trigger id='trigger-0'>attacks</trigger> on British soil. Capturing drones using swarms of net-casting UAVs working in tandem is one of several options being considered by defence chiefs. Developing radio frequency denial systems to create a forcefield-type wall around government sensitive areas could also form part of the longer-term strategy. British engineering firm OpenWorks already manufactures the SkyWall 100, an anti-drone bazooka which launches a net at flying objects and parachutes them to the ground. However, James Rogers, an expert in drone warfare who is associate lecturer at the University of York, predicted \u201cnon-kinetic options\u201d would ultimately prove more effective than \u201cblunt force\u201d tactics. \u201cThere are loads of different ways to <trigger id='trigger-1'>bring</trigger> down a drone,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s now about finding what is the most effective way to do it. If you <trigger id='trigger-2'>shoot</trigger> it down, well, what if it\u2019s rigged as an improvised explosive device?\u201d On being told about the upcoming test flight event, he said: \u201cThere is a big debate out there at the moment about what the best way is to <trigger id='trigger-3'>counter</trigger> these small drones, whether they are used by hobbyists causing a bit of a nuisance or in a more sinister manner by a terrorist actor.\u201d The ISIL terror group has already used basic, easy-to-buy drones to carry out reconnaissance and drop bombs in the region of Mosul, where the Iraqi government is retaking territory from the self-styled caliphate. US security services reportedly believe commercially available UAVs could in future be used by terrorists more widely to <trigger id='trigger-4'>carry</trigger> hazardous chemicals, radioactive material or grenades in Western cities. Rogers told E & T: \u201cWe talk about precision warfare with regards to American drone warfare. This is kind of the other side of it. These are precision missiles. You can hone in on your exact target. Proliferation of these precision technologies is what this is.\u201d Forcing drone manufacturers to programme their machines so that they have pre-set areas within their positioning systems which they are barred from entering could be part of the answer to the conundrum, Rogers said, although he added: \u201cYou can always override that, so it\u2019s a hard one.\u201d In the UK there are said to have been dozens of sightings in recent months of drones flying over sites deemed to be part of the country\u2019s critical infrastructure. It is not known if these were being flown by people harbouring harmful intent or just curious hobbyists. One well-placed source said he believed there had been thousands of such incidents recorded so far. Enthusiasts who flew drones over military sites were \u201cjust morons\u201d , he added. A British air safety watchdog yesterday revealed how an RAF Chinook helicopter at an airbase in Hampshire was nearly downed after it came within 130ft of <trigger id='trigger-5'>colliding</trigger> with a drone. The person controlling the drone was never tracked down. All agencies with responsibility for responding to emergencies are now factoring drones into their war games, according to Dave Sloggett, who runs exercises for the police, military and others. \u201cFor the last nine months, every single exercise I\u2019ve done for the emergency services has had a drone element in there somewhere,\u201d said Sloggett, who has also authored a book on drone warfare. Criminals have been known to use drones to <trigger id='trigger-6'>carry</trigger> drugs and mobile phones into prisons, over borders and even across the Straits of Gibraltar from Africa to Europe. Dutch and French police have reportedly trained several different species of eagle to catch drones in their talons. The Ministry of Defence is already pouring public money into developing so-called \u201cbiomimetic technology\u201d , producing drones based on natural forms, apparently for the purposes of intelligence gathering in urban environments. At the same time, the UK is hoping to capitalise on the economic and environmental benefits that could in future be reaped by having companies use drones to make deliveries.
